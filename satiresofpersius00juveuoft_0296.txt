THE SATIRES

SAT. vu.

ET spes et ratio studiorum in Caesare tantum :
Solus enim tristes hac tempestate Camenas
Respexit, quum jam celebres notique poetae
Balneolum Gabiis, Romae conducere fumos

5 Tentarent‚ nec foedum alii nec turpe putarent

l. ‘ Whatever hopes of reward or
motives for study litei-ary men may
have, are entirely owing to Caesar.’
Which of the Caesars is here ineant, is
a matter of controversy: (1) Nero:
(2) Titus: (3) Trajan; who built the
Ulpian library, Plin. Pan. 47: BRI.
GRA. R. (4) Hadriau3 Spartian. 33
16: R. (ὃ) Nerva; Mart. viii, 703 ix,
27; xii, 63 but he, though a poet
himself, was little disposed to patronise
poetry in others: (6) Domitiam Sch.
LUB. SM. GV. who, whatever vices
he had, was a patron of the Muses,
FAR. especially in the commence-
ment of his reign ς Suet. xii, 9; quo nec
prcesentius aliquid nec studiis magis
propitium numen θείς Quint. Pr. iv.
PRA. Quintilian, Martial, Statius,
Flaccus, and other learned men, tasted
of bis bounty, MAD. and sang his
praises with more gratitude, perhaps,
than truth. This dutiful prince had
once an idea of contesting the empire
with his father: finding the armies,
however, averse to his designs, he re-
tired from all public business, and, with
a specious appearance of content, lived
in a kind of solitude3 pretending that
poetry, and literary pursuits in general,
were his only passion. This mask he
continued to wear during the reign of
Titus 3 and whether it was that habit
begot a kind of nature, or that he
thought it dangerous to lay aside the
hypocrite too soon, he did certainly
patronise the arts at his accession.
That he afterwards changed his senti-
ments, and fell suddenly upon men of
letters, is equally certain t but this may
be readily accounted for, from his dis-
position, which was at once crafty and
violent; as represented beiphilin,lxvii,
beginning. According to the custom of
the emperors in selecting some favourite
deity for their worship, Domitian made
choice of Minerva. His attachment to
this goddess is frequently noticed by
Juvenal's contemporaries. Thus Mar-

tial. in that detestable medley offlattery
and impiety, ix, 43 Pallada proe-
terea: res ayil illa laas; 10; Suet. xii,
15. Massinger in his Roman Actor has
several ingenious and truly classica!
allusions to the reliance which the
tyrant fondly placed on the partiality
of this deity. A Pallas very generally
accompanies Domitian on the reverse
of his coins: Beger. Numism. xxxii, 4.
And we learn from a passage of Philo-
strates, that the emperor publicly de-
clared himself to be the son of Pallas,
and required accordingly that divine
honours should be paid to him. Vit.
Apoll. vii, 24; Plin. Pan. xxxiii, 4.
This satire would appear to have been
written in the early part of Domitian's
reign3 and Juvenal, by giving the
emperor ‘⁴ one honest line'’ of praise,
probably meant to stimulate him to ex-
tend bis patronage. He did not think
very ill of him at the time, while he
augured happily for the future. And,
indeed, the bitter mortification he felt
at finding his predictions falsified, and
his ‘ sole patron of literature' changed,
in a few years, into a. ferocious and
bloody persecutor of⁴all the arts', might
have exasperated his resentrnent, and
generated that intense hatred with
which he pursues his memory. GIF.
OW, L. ix, p. 215-217.
