THE SATIRES

SAT. VI.

Extendit pectitque comas et volvit in orbem.

Est in consilio matrona admotaque lanis

Emerita quae cessat acu ε sententia prima

Hujus erit3 post hanc aetate atque arte minores
500 Censebunt, tamquam famae discrimen agatur

Aut animae : tanta est quaerendi cura decoris.

Tot premit ordinibus, tot adhuc compagibus altum

AEdificat caput.

Post minor est : credas aliam.

Andromachen a fronte videbis ε

Cedo, si breve parvi

505 Sortita est lateris spatium breviorque videtur
Virgine Pygmaea, nullis adjuta cothurnis,
Et levis erecta consurgit ad oscula planta ?
Nulla viri cura interea, nec mentio fiet

iv. HNN. Juvenal‘s meaning is well
illustrated by the coins of Trajan and
Hadrian, and hence this satire would
seem to have been written during one
of those reigns. ΑΘΗ. Such, for in=
stance, is the head-dress of Trajan's
wife Plotina, of his sister Marciana, of

his niet-e Matidia, of Hadrian's wife
Sabina, and of his daughter Matidia.
This preposterous fashion did not con-
tinue at court above forty years, being
exploded by Annia Galeria Faustina,
the wife of Antoninus Pius. VAL. J.
