SATIRE VI.

ARGUMENT.

This is one of the most pleasing and original of these Satires. Its primary
object is to point out the proper use <of rit-hes: and the author (after a
beautiful exordium, in which the genius and learning of his friend
Bassus are comph'mented with all the warmth of friendship, 1..6 ;)
exhibits his own conduct in the regulation of his desires, as explanatory
of his views, 6. .24.

A kind and liberal attention to the necessities of obers is then recom-
mended; and the various artifices of avarice to disguise its sordid and
selfish feelings under the specious names of prudence, ancient simplieity,
a regard sor the welfare of successors, διες are detected and exposed
with marked severity, 25. ΑΟ.

The poem concludes with some sarcastic reproof of tho greediness of heirs
in expectatffin, 41. .74; and a striking description of the nature of
eupidity, which strengthens with indulgence, and becomes more craving ⁰
in proportion as it is more abundantly supplied, 7 5. ,80.

This Satire is not only the most agreeable and original, but the most in-
teresting of our author’s works. It was evidently written by him, under
the consciousness of irrecoverable diseasc, while yet in the flower of
youth, possessed of an independent fortune, of estimable friends, of
dear connection-², and of a cultivated mind; a situation in itself suffici-
ently affecting, and which is rendered still more so, by the placid, and
even cheerful spirit which pervades every part of the poem. GIF.
