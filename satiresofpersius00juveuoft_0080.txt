Quum primum pavido custos mihi purpura cessit

Bullaque succinctis laribus donata pependit3
Quum blandi comites, totaque impune Subura
Permisit sparsisse oeulos jam candidus umbo :
Quumque iter ambiguum est et vitae nescius error

33 MAD.) at first laying aside the dress
of their early years, and assuming the
garb of manhood. LUB. Cat. lxviii, 15

The praetexta was intended to be ‘ a

was a private ceremon53 the putting on
of the {oya was a public one. lf the
latter was performed at Rome, the youths
repaired immediately afterw ards to some
temple (generally to the Capitol) to
complete the ceremony by offering the
customary sacrifices. Being an act of
great solemnity, it frequently formed,
among the youths who changed their
gown at the same time, abond of fellow-
ship which subsisted unbroken through
life. GIF. Hor. Od. i, 36, 9.

50. These domestic deities, who were
rather regarded as palladia or amulets
than as gods of power, were probably

represented in the same homely garb .

which they wore before Rome became a
city. A kind of affectionate home-bred
superstition forbade all attempts at in-
novation in their costume. GIF. They
vvere dressed, aster the Gabinian fashion,
with their toga twisted over the lest
shoulder, leaving the right arm bare.

the gloss os newness on this momentous

The {oya was so arranged as to be
gathered into many plaits on the left
shoulder3 the centre, where all these

folds met, was called the umbo or ‘ boss! ’

Apul. xi. L. From this boss, the ex-
tremity of the lappet fell down before,
and was tucked into the girdle,forming
the sinus, (an apology for a pocket,) in
which papers and other light articles
were carried; and it is far from impro-
bable that some affected display was
made of it, in the pride of recent man-
hood. GIF.
