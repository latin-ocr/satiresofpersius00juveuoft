xii ¹PREFACE.

hatred of tyranny3 and his indignation is chiefly directed
against the emperor himself, whose hypocrisy, cruelty, and
licentiotlsness, now become the object of his keenest repro-
bation. Hc did not, indeed, recite any more in public; but
he continued to write during thc remainder of Domitian’s
reign, to which period we may assign several of his Satires ⁰.
In 96 A. D. the world was happily relieved from the despotism
of this tyrant: Nerva, who succeeded him, recalled the
exiles. From this time, therefore, there can be little doubt
of Juvenal's residing at Rome and pursuing his studies
without further molestation. His first Satire after Domitian’s
death would seem to be S. jvp3 and now he began to
revise for publication his previous writings, prefixing to them
S. i‘³, by way of introduction. To this period we may also
refer S. x‘ ; and S. xi, which probably closed his poetical
carcer⁵z unless we suppose S. xvi, to be genuine and left in
an unfinished state at the author's deam, which took place
at an advanced age, when he was upwards of fourscore.

This diversity of studies in the two authors before us has
given a widely different character to their writings. In one
we have the impassioned declaimer, in the other the uncom-
promising moralist. Persius, though he borrowed much of
the language of Horace, has little of his manner. The im-
mediate object of his imitation appears to be Lucilius. If
he lashes vice with less severity than his great prototype, we
must bear in mind that he lived in perilous times3 that he
was of a rank sufficiently distinguished to make such
frcedom dangerous, and of an age when life had yet lost
