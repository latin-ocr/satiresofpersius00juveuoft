Hau has imitated this passage with
much humour: “ What though he quaff
pure amber in his bowl Of March-
brew’d wheat3 he slakes thy thirsting
soul With palish oat frothing in Bostnn
clay, Or in a shallow cruize3 nor inust
that stay within thy reae-h, for sear of

Paelus Thrasea and his son-in-law
Helu-itlius Priscus, from their hatred of
tyranny‚ used to keep the birthdays of
the great liberators of Rome. The
former was put to death and the latter
banished by Nero. Galba recalled him
from exile3 which would be one motive
for our author’s partiality to that prince-
By Vespasian he was prosecuted on a
charge of sedition, but acquitted.
Thrasea was the son-in-law of that
Paetus, whose wife Arria is so justly
celebrated for her heroic constancy, in
the well-known epigram: Casta suo
gladium &a These names are not in-
serted so much to mark the excellence
of the wine as the poet's abhorrence of
Domitian; to whom these two patriots
were so peculiarly obuoxious, that he
put one person to death for calling
Thrasea a man of sanctity, and another
for writing the life of Helvidius. Sch.
Tac. A. xvi; Suet. vi, 373 xii, 10.
PRA. This is one of those impassioned
bursts into which our poet is so fre-
quently betrayed unpremeditatedly by
his enthusiastic love of liberty ; i, 16 ῖς
