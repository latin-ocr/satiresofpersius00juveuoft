‚SATIRE V.

ARGUMENT.

The poetica] and philosophical 01311115 of Persius rest, 10 some measure,

upon this poem; and it is but justice to say that they are not ill
supported by it.

The Satire consists of two parts3 the first expres sive of the poet’s deep
and grateful sense of the kindnes 55 of his friend and instructor, Cornutus

l. .;29 with a beautiful summary of the 111855 sings derived from his
wisdom and goodness· 30. (1.4.

The second part is a lahoured 3011 ostentatious display of our poet’s pro-
ficiency in the 85018110 doctrine of 1118 Stoie School; something must
here be forgiven to the ardour of youth, 111111 1118 vehemence of inex-
perienced virtue. This division of the Satire 15 principally occupied
with that celebrated paradox of the sect, that 1118 wise man alone is
essentially free, 65 ff3 and that the passions of avarice, 109 ff, luxury,
142 ff, love, 161. .175, ambition, 176 ff, superstition, 179 ff, and other
passions exercise as despotia a control over their victims as the severest
taskmaster over his slaves. It cannot 118 supposed that much new matter
should be produced upon 511811 3 topic. Both Persius and 1115 preceptor
came too late for this; and could only repeat, in other forms, what had

been said a thousand times before. But there may be ingenuity, where
there is no novelty; and this is not wanting.

Some amusement may be found in contrasting the sober earnestness of
Persius, with the solemn irony of Horace. The language of both is
much the same, and the conclusions do not greatly differ3 but the
Stertinius of the latter, in spite of his infiexible gravity, must have pro-
voked 1851511855 laughter; while the youthful poet commands respect,
and though he may fail 10 convince, always secures attention. GI F
