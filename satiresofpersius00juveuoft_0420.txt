:398 THE SATIRES

SAT. ΧΠ.

Accidit et nostro similis fortuna Catullo.

30 Quum plenus fluctu medius soret alveus et jam,
Alternum puppis latus evertentibus undis
Arboris incertae, nullam prudentia cani

Rectoris conferret opem ;

decidere jactu

Coepit cum ventis, imitatus castora, qui se

35 Eunuchum ipse facit, cupiens evadere damno
Testiculi: adeo medicatum intelligit inguen.
‘⁴ F undite, quae mea sunt,” dicebat, “ cuncta,’' Catullus,
Praecipitare volens etiam pulcerrima, vestem
Purpuream, teneris quoque Maecenatibus aptam,

40 Atque alias, quarum generosi graminis ipsum

31. Puppis here means ‘ the stern’ οι·

alvens is μέση νηῦς ‘the midship ;' both
are distinguished from σι’ρῶρη ‘ the fore

32. Arboris ‘ of the ship ς’ Ov. Her.

33. ‘ To compound ;’ Job ii, 43 MAD.

34. This anecdote of ‘the beaver' is

makes a very good illustration in our

author's hands. The same use of it is

40. There is not, perham, much more
foundation for this fact, than for that
mentioned in 343 the belief of it, how-
ever,was very general; and this is suf-
ficient for the poet. Martial frequently
speaks of this singular property of the
air and water of Baetica (Andalusia) in
staining the fleeces of the sheep kept
there, with a bright yellow or golden
hue: and Virgil, long before him, had
mentioned this faculty ofeommunicating
colours to the “ floeks at feed‚⁷’ as one
of the blessings of that golden period,
which was to eommence with the arrival
of young Pollio at man’s estate3 (ipse
sedin pratis aries jam suave rubenti
murice jam croceo mutabit vellera [πασς
sponte sua sandyx pascentes vestiet
agnon E. iv, 43 ff. PRA.) The truth
of this was not ascertained, because the
youth, whoever he was, died too soon;
but as nature is invariable, methinks the
wool of Andalusia should be as rich in
native grain now, as heretofore: perhaps
it is so: the Spanish shepherds, how-
ever, do not trust to this: they stain the
fleeces of their sheep at present with a
kind of ochre: probably they always
