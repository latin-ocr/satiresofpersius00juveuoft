an iron ring, plebeians one of silver,
and those of equestrian rank a golden
one. Freedmen were allowed to wear
the latter, if they had an equestrian
estate, but were not considered actual
knights. PLA. Ventilare may mean
‘totake offfmm the finger and fan back-
wards and forwards in order to cool it ;’
BRJ. or ‘ to wave the hand affectedly,
to and fro in the air, in order to show off
the ringt' ’γελαῖοι οἵ πλουτοῦντες. καὶ τὰς

GIF, on xi, 43. This *ί was not
anciently so great an hyperbole as it is
now, for Ι have seen old Roman rings
so very thick about, and with such
large stones in them, that 't is no won-
der a sep should reckon them a little
cumbersome in the summer season of
so hot a climate3’' ADD, R. p. 101.]

32. These ‘litters resembled oriental
palanquins: they were fitted up with
couches on which grandees οι· ladies
reclined, and were carried by six or

Either (l) Heliodorus the Stoic,
who laid an information against his
pupil L. Junius Silanus: or (2) Eg-

denounced his pupil Barea Soranus to
Nero, iii, 116; and was afterwards

Blassa, Carus, and Latinus were
freedmen of Nero and notorious in-
formexs. 'she two former were pul: to
death on the information of Heliodorus,
although they had given him bush-
mouey. The latter was executed on
suspicion of having intrigued with
