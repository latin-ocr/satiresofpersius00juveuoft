SATIRE XII.

—

ARGUMENT.

This is the shortest of J uvenal’s pieces3 yet it is by no means wanting iu
good passages some of much moral foree; and many of a pathetic and
affectionate tendency.

Catullus, sor whom he had eonceived a friendshjp of the liveliest kind, had
narrowly escaped shipwreck; and the Poet, whose joy knows no bound
on the occasion, (a proof of his not being deficient in the “ socia] affec-
tions,”) addresses an exulting letter to their common friend, Corvinus;
in which, after acquainting him that he was then about to sacrifice the
victims he had vowed for the safety of Catullus, 1 . .16; he describes his
danger and escape. 17. .82. ⁸

He then gives a most beautiful and animated picture of the private part of
the. solemnity, and of the various marks of gratulation which his house
exhibits; 83..92. So far we see nothing but the pious and grateful

friend.

The Satirist now takes his turn most adroitly and unexpectedly: he re·
collects that sacrifices are vowed by others, for the preservation of their
acquaintance; this leads him to speak with manly confidence of his own
ffisinteoestedness, which he considers as almost unique; and which he
opposeS, with equa] spirit and success, to the base and designing promises
of the legacy hunters, by whom the sick-beds of the rich and childless
were constantly surrounded, 93. .l27; and he concludes with an appro-
priate malediction on such heartless and selfish wretches. 128. .130.

With the former part of this Satire may be compared Horace, Ode i, 36 ;
ii, 7 ; iii, 14; and Catullus, ix. With the latter part, Lucian, Dialogues
of the Dead, v. ,κς and Horace, Satire ii, 5. Of Juvenal’s two friends
we know nothing. R.
