THE SATIRES

SAT. XI·

Illa domi natas nostraque cx arbore mensas

finished masses of stone, as well as to
the first shapeless blocks which were
set up in the temples, was the profound
reverence entertained for the god83
which did not suffer the artists to in-
vest them too closely with a determinate
form. In process of time they grew
holder: and it is an observable thing
in the history of sculpture, that the
most admired statues of the deities were
produced in the age of scepticisrn, or
infidelity. This applies no less to the
Greeks than to the Romans: the latter,
while they were sincere believers in
their mythology, had not a god tolerably
executed. GIF. s. Virg. ii, 465 f.
