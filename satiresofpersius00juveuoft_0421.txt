take frequent notice of the immoderate
love of the women for wine. The fol-
lowing passage is very hummous, and
witha! so ardent, that 1 doubt whether
the most hrain-siclt lover ever poured
out such genuine strains of rupture to
his goddes8‚ as the bibulous old lady
before us lavishes on her darling liquor:

These ‘ baskets' (almost the only manu-
facture of our simple ancestors) seem to
have excited the admiration, if not the
envy of the Romans, by the beauty of
their workmanship. It is curicus to
observe how greatly the most savage
nations excel in this kind of rusb-work.
Vaillant speaks of some baskets which
he found among the people of Caffraria3
and our navigators have brought from
the new-discovered isles, specimens of
art in this branch, which our expertest
basket-makers would strive in vain to
equal. It is some little compliment to
our forefathers, that their conquerors
adopted the name with the article,
which must have borne a high price, if
we may judge from the value of the
precious effects among which it is enu-
merated. GIF. “BASKET, Bascauda,
a basket3 basket (loru, a haud-baskem

see in Martial, &c.'’ Pryce, Archaeol.

Etis wanting before mullum. The
omission of the conjunction is common
in Juvenal, and is sometimes awkward
as in vi, 1183 604; viii, 27. R.

47. Philip of Macedon bribed Las-
thenes and Eurycrates to betray Olyn-
thus [now Agios Mamas, A W.] into his
power. Because he ever afterwards
spoke of them as traitors, they hung
themselves 3 Sch. s. Demosth. 01. Thuc-
i, 58 ff; Diodoruxvi, 53 f. Philip bought
many cities in this way3 Sen. Ep. 94.
Once when he was about to attack a
certain castlc, the scouts brought him
word that the road was impracticablo;
the king immediately asked u’ χαλκὸν

with a gold cup under his pillowt Plin.
