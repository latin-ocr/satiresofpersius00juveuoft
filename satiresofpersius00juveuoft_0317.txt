199. Ρ. Ventidius Bassus was born
at Asculum in the Picenian territory,
and led in triumph, with his mother,
among the captives taken in the Social
War by Cn. Pomp. Strabo, father of
Pompey the Great. He became au
errand-buy, next a wagouer, then a
muleteer, a soldier, centurion, and (by
the influenee of Caesar and the two
Antonii) tribune os the people, praetor,
and, in the same year, pontiff and con-
sul. He obtained a splendid triumph
(201 ς) over the Parthians, and, finally,
was honoured with a public funeral.
His elevatiou to the consulship was
considered, at the time, as an extra-
ordinary event, and gave rise to many
sarcastic effusions. One of these is
come down to us: concurrite onmes
auyures, aruspices! portentum inusi-
tatum conflatum est Νεᾶνις,- nam mulos
qui fricabat consul sactus est; Gen.
xv, 4. Time, however, which does

justice to merit, established his claims

and silenced, perhaps shamed, his ene-
mies. V. Max. vi, 9 f; Cic. Ep. Fam.
