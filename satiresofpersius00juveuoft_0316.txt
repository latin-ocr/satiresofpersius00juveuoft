Hos inter sumtus sestertia Quintiliano,

Ut multum, duo sufficient.
Constabit patri, quam filius.

xxxvi, 63 PRA. id. v, 33 Stat. S. i, 5,
36; (BA.) R. id. quoted in the note on
iii, 258.

183. The rich had different dining-
parlours‚ according to the different sea-
sons of the year. Varr. L. L. iv; s.
Suet. ii, 723 vi, 31; OS. Col. i,

187. ‘ At the outside.’ The whole
of this passage, (from 1783) seems
an imitation of Crates the Theban:
τίθει μαγείρῳ μνᾶς δέκα, ἰατρῷ δραχμὴν,
κόλακι τάλανιοι δέκα, συμβούλῳ καπνὸν,
ποξνῃ τάλαντον. φιλοσόφῳ τριώβολον· Eph.
in his Life by Laert. ΘΚΑ.

188. Filius ‘ the education of a son.y

Juvenal instances Quintilian as a
rich man, while Pliny, in a letter
which does equal honour to himself
and his master, (for such Quintilian
ψει-5,) talks of his moderate fortune,
vi,32. This discrepaucy may be ac-
counted for by the different circum-
stances of the two writers. What ap-
peared immense to Juvenal, might be
far from seeming so to such a wealthy

man as Pliny. It is satisfactory, how-
ever, to know, that this amiable and
virtuous character experienced none of
the neglect and poverty which over-
whelmed so many ofhis brethren. GIF.
R. He taught rhetoric for twenty

192. senators had black shoes of
tanned leather3 the form was some·
what like a short boot, reaching nearly
to the middle of the leg, as they are

number of senators was one hundred.

(OA.) Marcellus derives the origin of
this ornament from the Tuscans (s.
Serv. on Virg. AE. viii, 458 ;) and from
Mercury, who, in rescuing AEneas from
the Greeks, placed ἁστερὲεντα περὶ σφυρὰ
