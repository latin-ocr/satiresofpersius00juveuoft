THE SATIREs

sAT. 1x.

Illos ergo roges, quidquid paulo ante petebas

115 A nobis.

Taceant illi: sed prodere malunt

Arcanum, quam subrepti potare Falerni,
Pro populo faciens quantum Saufeia bibebat.
Vivendum recte est, cum propter plurima, tum his
Praecipue causis, ut linguas mancipiorum

120 Contemnas: nam lingua mali pars pessima servi.
Deterior tamen hic, qui liber non erit illis,
Quorumanimas et farre suo custodit et aere.

“ †Idcirco ut possim linguam contemnere servi,†

Utile consilium modo, sed commune, dedisti:

125 Nunc mihi quid suades post damnum temporis et spes
Deceptas? Festinat enim decurrere velox

with the ears' is not an unusual meta-
phor. ΟΥ. SVL. Prop. iii, 6; Hor. Od.

the Greek ῥέζειν and the Hebrew nwy
are used absolutely, in the same sense.

R. Livy xxii, 10. 5.

This Saufeia, who turned a religious
ceremony into a drinking-bont, was
mentioned, vi, 320. The Roman ladies
were so fond of strong liquor, (s. xii,45;)
that Cicero thought it expedient, in the
regulation of his imaginary republic, to
prohibit their officiating at any of the
sacred rites, (at which wine was always
used,) after night-fall. The only ex-
ception he made was this before us to
Bona Dea3 and we see how it was
abused! nocturna mulierum sacre-'ficia
ne szc›zto,proeter olla,quae pro populo
ritefiant. LUB. GIF.

118. “Abstain from fleshly lusts,
which war against the soul; having
your conversation honest among the
Gentiles: that whereas they speak
against you as evil doers, they may, by

your good works which they shall be-
hold, glorify God ;'’ 1 St Peter ii, ll f;
iii, 16; MAD. conscia mens reclisamae
mendavia ride& Ov. F. iv, 311. R.
[Rambler No 68.]

121. It was the maxim of the Stoics,
that πάντες κακοὶ δοῦλοι· S. Hor. S. ii,
7, 81-943 Ep. i, 16, 63-68. R.

122. Animas-3 vi, 501; xv, 94. R.

The monthly allowance to a slave
was four (Donat. on Ter. Phor. i, l, 93)
or five (Sen. Ep. 80;) pecks of corn,
and as many denarii. S. vii, 120. R.

124. ‘The advice you have given is
excellent, but it is general. Pray,
what would you recommend in my own
particular case ,Ψ PRA.

This passage is overloaded with epi-
thets: and has, besides, a mixture of
metaphors; as ἆ πίπους κατέφλεξε
τὶ πρὶν θεοείκελον ‹2‘ νέος· Rufin.Ep.viii,
5, in ΒΟ, An. t. ii, p. 392. R. Where
metaphors from frequent use have be-
come naturalized as ir were, this inac-
curate combination of figures is not un-
usual; JC'. as in Lucr. i, 645. [FEE,
in GIF, prf. to Per.]

Demo-rere: [Like the sands in an
bour-glass. The metaphor may be
from a mountain stream, monte decur-
rens velut amnis. Hor. O. iv, 2, 5.]
