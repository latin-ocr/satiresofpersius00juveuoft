45 Brachia Vulcanus Liparaea nigra taberna.
Prandebat sibi quisque (leus nec turba dearum
Talis, ut est hodie, contentaque sidera paucis
Numinibus miserum urguebant Atlanta minori

Pondere.

Nondum aliquis sortitus triste profundi

50 Imperium : aut Sicula torvus cum conjuge Pluton ;
Nec rota nec Furiae nec saxum aut vulturis atri
Poena; sed infernis hilares sine regibus umbrae.
Improbitas illo fuit admirabilis aevo.

most simple exposition: that ‘After the
nectar had been all drained from the
bowl, Vulcan wiped his arms, black
from his Liparaean workshop.' To
throw the greater ridicule over these
celestial compotations, and to make at
the same time, the widest contrast be-
tween Vulcan and the fair cup-bearer
just mentioned, the former is repre-
sented as coming hot from the forge,
and not even having the good manners
to make himself decent and tidy, till
the banquet and his services were over.
He did then make himself so far com-
fortable as to rub the sweat and soot off
his bare arms, but not till then. Livy
iii 26.

46. This is a severe satire on the
Pagan Polytheism. PRA. s. Plin. ii,
7; Cic. N. D. R. The heathen deities
amounted to above thirty thousand.
MAD. But our author had a further
and more important end in view; for
his satire is directly levelled at the
frequent apotheoses of the Caesam, in
which the base and abject herd of
Rome contentedly acquiesced. The
deifying of such characters, and of a
multitude of imaginary beiugs little less
odious and contemptible, is alleged by
implication‚ aa the prime cause of the

increased depravity of the times. To
have spoken plainer would have been
unsafe3 to have lest the subject un—
touched, unlike our author. GJF. [s.
