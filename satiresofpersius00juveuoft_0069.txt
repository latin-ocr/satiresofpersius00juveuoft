ARGUMENT.

This Satire (ofwhich many have supposed Nero to be the object) is founded
on the first Alcibiades of Plat0; and many of the expressions are closely
copied from that celebrated dialogue3 l ff.

It naturally arranges itself under three heads‚ the first of which treats of
the preposterous ambitium of those who aspired to take the lead in state

affairs, before they had learned the first principles of civil government 3
l . . 22.

The second division, which is of singular merit, and possesses a rich vein of
strong but appropriate humour, and acute reasoning, turns on the general
neglect of sels-examinati0n3 23 f; it euforces, at the same time, the nc-
cessity of moral purity, from the impossibility of escaping detection; and
points out the policy of restraining all wauton propensity to exaggerate
others' foihles‚ from its tendency to provoke severe recrimiuation on our—

solves ; 25 . .46.

The conclusion, or third part, reverts to the subject with which the satire
opens, and arraigns, in terms of indignant severity, the profligacy of the
young nobility, and their sottish vanity in resting their claims to appro-
bation on the judgement of a worthless rabble; 46. ‚52. GJF.

To read this Satire, may be useful to the young. It may help to correct
petulance3 it may serve to warn inexperience. It may teaeh the youthful
statesman, that, even in remote times, and in small states, government
was considered as a most fflffioult science. It may show the high-born
libertine, that, in proportion as the sphere in which he moves is wide and

brilliant, are his conduct and character conspicuous, and his follics ridi-
culous; DMD [St Matthew v, 14.]
