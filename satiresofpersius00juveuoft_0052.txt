THE SATlRES

SAT. 11.

Somnia pituita qui purgatissima mittunt,
Praecipui sunto sitque illis aurea barba.’'
Aurum vasa Numae Saturniaque impulit aera,

60 Vestalesque urnas et Tuscum fictile mutat.

O curvae in terras animae et caelcstium inanes !

Quid juvat hos templis nostros immittere mores
Et bona dis ex hac scelerata ducere pulpa?

somewhat profited hy the ethical dia-
logue from which his subject is taken :
it is certain, that a brighter gleam must
have occasionally broken upon the dark-
ness of his mind, than the torch of Plato
ever afforded : that he was uneonscious
of its source, is his misfortune. What
Cornutus thought of this, cannot be
t01d3 he could not but see, however,
that though the words, in this section,
were those of the Porch, they were
used in a more spiritual sense than the
wisest and best of its sectaries ever
gave them. GIF. {The metaphor is
taken from Vir. E. iii, 42]
