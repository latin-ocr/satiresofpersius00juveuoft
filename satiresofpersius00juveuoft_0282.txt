THE SATIRES

SAT. vl.

Scilicet et tenui popano corruptus, Osiris.

Quum dedit ille locum 3 cophino soenoque relicto

Arcanam Judaea tremens mendicat in aurem,

Interpres legum Solymarum et magna sacerdos
545 Arboris ac summi fida internuntia eceli.

Implet et illa manum, sed parcius: aere minuto

Qualiacumque vole-s J udaei somnia vendunt.

Spondet amatorem tenerum vel divitis orbi

Testamentum ingens, calidae pulmone columbae

random: that bird was usually sacrificed
to Isis, and in Egypt constituted the
chief food of her priests. The Romans
were at first a little scandalized at this
treatment of the ancient guardian of
their capitol, but use soon reconciled
them to it. GIF. Herod. ii, 453 GRA.
ib. 37.

541. 4 The thin cake,’ λαγαξᾶν· Phi-
lostr. V. Ap. V, 93 Ov. F. i, 453 s;

lt is Osiris, and not Isis, who is of-
fended. The goddess understood her
trade too well, to be offended seriously
with a peccadillo of this kind ; but then
itwas necessarythatherhusband should
be represented as extremely delicate on
the subject ; otherwise, no goose for the
priest. GJF. Macr. i, 20 f; PRA. viii,

542. See iii, 14 ff; PRH. Domitian
laid a heavy poll-tax on this people3
and, that they might not erade it, they
were enjoined not to appear abroad
without the basket and hay, the badges
of their condition. To avoid being de-
tected and insulted by the rabble when
they entered the city, these poor perse-
cuted wretches laid aside their degrading
accompaniments. This accounts for
the epithet tremens, which Juvenal
applies to the female fortune-teller3
who, ifshe had been discovered, would,
in spite of her lofty pretensions, have
been severely punished for contempt of
the imperial regulations. GIF. Mart.
vii, 553 SVL. Suet. xii, 123 Joseph.
B. J. vii, 7. PRA.

543. Tremens may also mean ‘ shiver-
ing,' as. beggars do, to excite compas-
sion. y, 11. GRA. α matre doctus
rogare Judaeum Mart. xii, 57, 13.

544. ‘ Expounder of the laws os Je-

rusalem.’ BRI. Plin. v, 14. PRA.

By the words ‘ high-priestess of the
tree’ is probably meant ‘ of the Egerian
grove,' the degradation of which is so
indignantly deplored in the third Satire-
Like the Norwood of our metropolis, it
might be frequented by such of the
vulgar as were anxious to enquire their
sortunes. In that case some favourite
tree might be the place of rendezvous,
and this Betty Squires its most infal-
lible oracle. GIF. Sen. Med. 349.

545. Nil praeter nubes et coeli nu-
men adoram& xiv, 97. R.

‘ The trustworthy agent by whom the
will of heaven is revealed.' Augurs
and birds are called Jovis internun-
cii et interpretes3 Cic. Phil. xiii,
53 Div. ii, 34. R.

546. The Jews appear then to have
held the same place in society, as Gipsies
at the present day. GRA.

547. See Ezekiel xiii, “Have ye
not seen a vain vision, and have ye
not spoken a lyfing divination,
whereas ye say, The Lord saith it:
alheit I have not spoken ?'' 7 ς “ Will
ye pollute me for handfuls of barley
and for pieces of bread ΞΜ ibid. 19 &03
MAD. Pers. ii, 57. KG.

548. Spondet, ‘solemnly engages‚’ is
a stronger word than promittit3 iii, 433
Cic. for Mur. 41 end3 Sen. Ep. 19;
Ov. Her. 16,114; V. Flac. vi, 117;
(BU.) de infante Scribonius mathe-
maticus praeclara spopondit5 Suet. iii,
14; viii, 4. R.

549. ⁴ The lungs,' the liver, and the
heart were the parts chiefly examined
in divinations. Luc. i, 621 ff; Cic. de
Har. Resp. 9; Dio 393 58. R.

‘Doves’ were sacrificed to Venus,
