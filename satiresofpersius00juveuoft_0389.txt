SAT. Χ.

OF JUVENAL. 367

Assaraci magnis solennibus, Hectore funus

260 Portante ac reliquis fratrum cervicibus inter
Iliadum lacrumas, ut primos edere planctus
Cassandra inciperet scissaque Polyxena palla,
Si foret exstinctus diverso tempore, quo non
Coeperat audaces Paris aedificare carinas.

265 Longa dies igitur quid contulit? Omnia vidit
Eversa et flammis Asiam ferroque cadentem.
Tunc miles tremulus posita tulit arma tiara
Et ruit ante aram summi J ovis, ut vetulus bos,
Qui domini cultris tenue et miserabile collum

270 Praebet, ab ingrato jam fastiditus aratro.

Exitus ille utcumque hominis: sed torva canino ,ν 2³2.

commonly hired sor the purpose) break
’out at stated intervals into piercing
lamentations‚ which are instantly taken
up and re-echoed by the whole proces-
sion. It is a solemn and an affecting
service. GIF. Plin. vii, 443 xviii, 3;

262. The female mourner‚ who took
