THE SATIRES

SA‘r. vu.

Sed defluit aetas

Et pelagi patiens et cassidis atque ligonis.
Taedia tunc subeunt animos, tunc seque suamque

Accipe nunc artes, ne quid tibi conferat iste,

Spenser as well as Juvenal in his mind:
‘⁴ The plowman is rewarded ; only we,
That sing⁷ are paid with our own
melody: Rich churles have learnt to
praise us, and admire‚ But have not
learnt to think us worth the hire. So
when great Juno⁷s beauteous bird dis-
plaies Her starry tail, the boyes do run
and gaze At her proud train ;'' Poems

36. ‘⁶ Hear now what sneaking ways
your patrous find To save their darling
gold.’' The Bufo of Pope is shadowed
out in part from this animated passage:
‘⁶ Till grown more frugal in his riper
days, He paid some bards with port,
and some with praise; To some a dry
rehearsal was assign'd⁷ And others,
harder still ! he paid in kind.''
[“ PATRON : commonly a wretch who
supports with insolence, and is paid
with fiattery :'' JO, n.] There is
a very good story told by Macrobius,
which will not be much out of the way
here. A Greek poet had presented
Augustus Caesar with many little com-

pliments, in hopes of some trifiing re-
muneration. The emperor, who found
them worth nothing, took no notice of
the poor man, but as he persisted in
offering him his adulatory verses, com-
posed himself an epigram in praise of
the poet; and when he next waited on
him with his customary panegyric, pre-
sented his own to him with amazing
gravity. The man took and read it with
apparent satisfac-tion 3 then putting his
hand into his pocket, he deliberately
drew out two sarthings and gave them
to the Emperor, saying, οὗ κατὰ ἀι
τύχην, ὦ σέβαστε· εἰ ‘thalmai εἶχον, πλείονα.
ἂν καὶ ἐδίδουν· “· ’.ἰ his is· not equal to the
demands- of your situation, Sire; but
'tis all I have: if I had more Ι would
give it you.'’ Augustus, who was not
an illnatured man, could not resist this3
he burst into a fit of laughter, and as
Macrobius says, made the poet a hand-
some present3 ii, 4. [A somewhat
similar anecdote is told of Dean Swift
and a postillion.] In allusion to this
passage the Italians relate that Pius
the third, on being presented with a
panegyric in verse, by one who expected
a pecuniary return, gave him the fol-
lowing distich: “Discite pro numeris
numeros sperare, poctoe, mutare est
animas carmina, non emere.” To which
the other instantly replied: “ Si tibipro
numeris numeros Fortuna dedisset, mm
esset capiti tanta corona tuo-'' It must
be eonfessed that the Pope and his friend
make but a sorry figure by the side of
Augustus and his Greek poet; who
surpass them as much in genuine hu-
mour, as in urbanity and good breeding.
GJF. ‘ The temple of the Muses’ (or
rather of Hercules Musagetes) was
dedicated by Fulvius Nobilior and re-
stored by Marcius Philippus; that of
Apollo was built by Augustus in the
Palatium. These edifices were used
both as libraries, and as rooms where
men of letters might assemble for the
purpose of conversation or recitation;
