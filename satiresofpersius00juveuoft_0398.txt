SATIRE XI.

ARGUMENT.

This Satire consists principally of an invitation to Persicus, the poet's
friend, to spend the day with him3 but it is made the vehit-le of much
valuahle information, and much amusing description. It begins with a
severe invective against a person of the equestrian order, (here called
Rutilus,) who had wasted his property in riot and confusion3 and from
whose reduced and miserable state Juvenal takes occasion to draw many
admirable maxims for the due regulation of life. 1. .55. These intro-
duce, with sufficient propriety, the little picture of his own domestic
economy3 56 ff3 which is followed by a most pleasing view of the sim-
plicity of ancient manners, 60 ff3 77. . l l93 artfully contrasted with the
extravagance and luxury of the current times. 120 ff.

He enters at length into the particulars of his purposed entertainment; the
viands are the produce of his own little farm and garden: 64 ff; the
furniture is of the most homely kind: 129 ff; the servants are two
raw country lads born on the estate: 142 ff ; the wines, home-made:
159. ,161 ; and he concludes with a spirited description of the scandalous
excesses practised at the tables of the great ; 162 ff ; as a substitute for
which, our host promises Persicus the treat of hearing the immortal
poetry of Homer and Virgi13 177 ..180 ; and with an earnest recom-
mendation to his friend, to enjoy the present with content, and to await
the future with calmness and moderation. 184. .208. GIF. R.

This is apparently one of Juvenal's last works. It has all the charac-
teristics of age3 the laudator temporis acti is ever foremost in the scene;
and it is pleasant to think that time had mellowed and improved the
social feelings of the author. Not bnt what there is here much to be
seen of those strong and elevated passions which distinguish his earlier
writings3 yet softer and more amiable sentiments have their turn; and
the talkative old man appears as a warm friend, a generous landlord, and
a most kind and affectionate master of a family.

His guest does not appear in such an amiable light. He is a morose and
suspicions character3 sufficiently unhappy, it seems, in his domestic
concerns3 but fretful and fidgetty about many things, which Juvenal
seems to think, he had much better dismiss from his thoughts. GJF.
