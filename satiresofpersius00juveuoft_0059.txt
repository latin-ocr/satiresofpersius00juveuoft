(Quid metuas ?) cultrixque soci secura patella.
Hoc satis ? An deceat pulmonem rumpere ventis,
Stemmffte quod Tusco ramum, millesime, ducis:

Non pudet ad morem discincti vivere Nattae ?

(Ml. DOE.) More eost was lavished on
it than on the rest of the furniture. In
the oorest times, the most frugal and
rigitlj of the old republicans indulged
themselves with a silver salt,which,with
the patella, (a little platter for the offer-
ing to the household gods,) was sre-
quently all the plate they possessed.
When the necessities of the state
obliged the senate to call for a general
sacrifice of the gold and silver of the
people, the salt -cellar and the paten
were expressly exempted from the con-
tribution. (Livy xxvi, 36. ED.) Here
it appears put for plate in general,
furniture, and establishment. ΜΗΘ.

once savourite song, “ Ere around the
huge oak,'’ we have a similar use of
this metaphor : “ The farm I now hold
on your honour's estate Is the same
that my grandfather till’d. He, dying,
beqneathed to his son a good name,
Which u n s ull i e d (purum) descended

29. There was a twofold lustration or
muster ofthe Roman knights, censio and
trausveetio; the latter is here meant. Z
The c-eggsio was held every giye years,
the transbectio annually, ἐξέτασις ἰτηςίμ· ,1
Dio. I'H'the‘forffi’e‘r, which was strictly
a review, the knights marched on foot,
leading their horses; in the latter, they
rode: in fact, the ceremony had more of
military pomp than service in it, as they
appeared in grand costume, (trabeati,
Juv. viii, 259, note. PAR.) and crowned
with olive wreaths. On these occasions,
the knights assembled in the temple of
Mars without the walls, and rode
through the principal streets to the
Capitol, defiling by the censore, who
sat in front of the temple of Castor in
the Forum, and saluting them as they
passed. Augustus revived this ancient
custom which had fallen into disuse:
Suet. ii, 38. After it had flourished for
a few years, the emperors assumed the
censorial office among others, but
neglected its duties; and the practice
was soon finally dropped. MRC. GIF.
