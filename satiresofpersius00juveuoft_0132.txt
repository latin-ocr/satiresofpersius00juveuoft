THE SATIRES OF JUVENAL.

SAT. 1.

Experiar, quid concedatur in illos,

Quorum F laminia tegitur cinis atque Latina.

iii, 333; xxi, 192. R. Juvenal is very
fond of adopting Virgilian expressions ;
see 613 ii, 99; 1003 vi, 443 (s, i, 363)
xii, 943 &c- HNR.

Galeatus denotes not merely ‘ a sol-
dier‚' as in viii, 2383 but one who has
buckled on his helmet; (s. vi, 252·,
[1 Kings xx, 11 ;]) since it appears
from Trajan's Pillar, that before sol-
diers went into battle, their helmets
were suspended from the right shoulder.

Set-03 compare St Luke xiv, 31.

Duellum is the ancient form offellum,
and hence the word perduellis· F.

170. The Poet declares that he will
wage war on the dead alone. PRA.
Hali, on the contrary, says·‚ ‘⁴ 1 will
not ransack up the quiet grave, Nor
burn dead bones as he example gave3
I tax the living, let the ashes rest,
Whose faults are dead, and nailed in
their chest.’' Yet Han, like Juvenal,
makes use of the names of those de-
parted. GIF.

171. ‘The Flaminian and Latin
ways,⁷ as well as the Appian‚ were

adorned on either side with the sepul-
chres of many illustrious men: Sch. v,
553 i'or the laws of the Twelve Tables
prohibited sepulture within the walls.
The Latin way led to Sinuessa. PRA.
[Job xviii, 17; and xxi, 27; (nn.) “ In
all the old highways, that lead from
Rome, one sees several little ruins on
each side of them, that were formerly
so many sepulchres; sor the ancient
Romans generally buried their dead
near the great roadS. None, but some
few of a very extraordinary quality,
having been interred within the walls
of the city. Our christian epitaphs,
that are to be seen only in churches or
in church-yards, begin often with SISTE
V1A‘ron! v1ATon PRECARE SALU-
TEMl ETc. probably in imitation of
the old Roman inscriptions, that gene-
rally addressed themselves to the tra-
vellers3 as it was impossible for them
to enter the city, οι· to go out of it,
without passing through one of these
melancholy roads, which for a great
length was nothing else but a street of
funeral monuments.'’ ADD, R. p. 58.]
