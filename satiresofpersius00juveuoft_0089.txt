110 Jam nunc adsffingas, jam nunc granaria laxes?
Inque luto fixum possis transcendere numum,
Nec glutto sorbere salivam Mercurialem?

115 Sin tu, quum fueris nostrae paullo ante farinae,

Pelliculam veterem retines et fronte politus

Astutam vapido servas sub pectore vulpem,

Nil tibi concessit ratio ε digitum exsere, peccas;
