102. Tradidit. [From this it appears
that tradition might be written as
well as oral3 s. 11 Thessalonians ii,
15; (nn.) iii, 63 1 St Peter i, 18.]

A copy of the Pentateuch, or five
books of Moses, was kept (as it is
to this day) in every synagogue, locked
up in a press or chest (arca), and
never exposed to sight, unless when
'brought out to be read at the time of
worship: at the conclusion of the ser—
vice, it was returned to its place and
again locked up. MAI).

of Moses’ inculcates justice and hu·
manity to strangers by the most forcihle
and pathetic appeals to the feelings
of the people: S. Exodus xxii, 2!;
xxiii, 9; 123 Deuteronomy xxiv, 1422.

Moses with the two most interesting ob-

x, 18 f. Our author was confessedly as
ignorant of the laws as of the practices
ot· the Jews: all that he says amounts
to nothing more than the old charges
against them, which had been refuted

again and again. Even while he was
writing, <Iosephus had noticed and re-
pelled them: μηνύειν δὲ καὶ τὰς ὅδοῖις τοῖς

pagans talked of Moses, but they knew
him only through the corrupt sects into
which, in its latter age, Judaism was
divided. From this circumstance alone,
came all that abuse os the Hebrew
system, with which the Greek and ἦ
Roman writers abound, and which has
been, either ignorantly or wilfully, con· c.

confined to the old, hackneyed in the
ways of the world, and who, having
worn out the trifling affections which
they ever had, would subject those of
their children to the maxims of worldly
prudence. This we learn from fiction
and the drama, where the worldly wis-
dom of age is always represented as
opposed to the generous but imprudent

our better and inore enlightened days,
