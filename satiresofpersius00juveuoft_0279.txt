Io, the daughter of Inachus, was
beloved by Jupiter; who endeavoured
to conceal her, under the form of a
‘ white' heifer, from Juno’s jealousy.
That goddess, however, contrived to
obtain possession of her rival, and com-
mitted her to the eustndy of Argus,
with whose hundred eyes, after he was
slain by Mercury, the queen of heaven

The absurd and contemptible cere-
monies of the priests of Isis are de-
scribed with admirable spirit and hu-
mour. It is not easy to say by what
criterion the Romans judged of the
admissibility of foreign divinities into
their temples. Cybele, with all her
train of wild and furious enthusiasts‚
found an easy admittance3 while Isis
and Osiris, deities not more detestable..

were long opposed, and still longer re·
garded with distrust and aversion. Of
a truth, however, this was confined to
the men; the women seem to have
found something peculiarly fascinating
in the worship of Isis, and to have
been, from the first, her warmest de-
votees. Eitber because the envy of
the priests of Cybele, and other exotic
divinities, was excited by this marked
predilection, or because the attendance
on the rites of Isis was made (as it '
certainly was in aftertimes) a cloak for
intrigue3 in the consulship of Piso and
Gabinius, a furious persecution was
raised against her; and she was ba-
nished, with all her ridiculous mum-
mery, from the territories of the re-
public. Some years afterwards, how-
ever, her worship was re-established,
when Tiberius, on account of an im-
pious farce which was played in one of
her temples, (doseph. A. J. xviii3)
rased it to the ground, hanged or cru-
cified the priestS, and flung the statue
of the goddess into the T iber. Again
the temple was rebuilr, again destroyed
by a decree of the senate, and again,
and again, re· construeted, till the vigi-
lance of the government was finally
remitted, or its obstinacy overcome.
It was then, that these sanes rose on
all sides, and became (what too many
of the Roman temples were) the fa-
vourite spots for forming assignations.
Whenever Juvenal has occasion to
mention these Egyptian divinifies, he
does it with a contemptuous sneer3
but in this he is not singular, since
almost every ancient writer on the
subject does the same. Lucan conveys
a bitter reproach to his countrymen for
their partiality to them, in a pathetic
and beautiful apostrophe to Egypt, on
the murder of Pompey: nos in templa
tuam Romana accepimus Isin, semi-
deosque canes et sistra jubentza luctus
et quem tu plangens hominem testaris
Osirim: iu nostros, AEyypte, tenes in
vui,
831 ff. But it would be endless to
quote all the indignant ridicule that
has been poured on these brutal super·
stitions. With all this, however, they
continued in full vigour from our au-
