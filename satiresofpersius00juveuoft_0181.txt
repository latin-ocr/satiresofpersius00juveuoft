OF JUVIJTNAL.

Respice nunc alia ac diversa pericula noctis:
Quod spatium tectis sublimibus, unde cerebrum

Vasa cadant3 quanto percussum pondere signent

Et laedant silicem.

Ergo optes votumque feras miserabile tecum,
Ut sint contenta= patulas defundere pelves.
Ebrius ac petulans, qui nullum sorte cecidit,
Dat poena8‚ noctem patitur lugentis amicum

268. Now follows an animated and
faithful picture of the evils of night:
these are nearly the same in every over-
grown capital, which is not protected
by aFnight-wateh or a vigilant police.

the danger. LUB. quum arec? compla-

278. A vivid picture is now presented
of the wauton insults to which the poor
were exposed from the midnight frolics
of drunken bullies. Nero was one of
the first of these disturbers of the public
peace. Tac. xiii, ‘253 Suet. vi, 26.
Under shelter of his example private
persons took the opportunity to annoy
the public: every quarter was filled
with tumult and disorder, and Rome,
at night, resembled a city taken by
storm: s. Dio. Otho, Commodus, Helio-
gabalus, Verus, &o were also addioted
to the same brutal joke. Suet. viii, 2.

and scarce any durst walke the streets
with safety after nine at night;'’ The
Five Yeares of King lamas, by Sir
Foulk Grevill, late Lord Brook, p. 3.]
