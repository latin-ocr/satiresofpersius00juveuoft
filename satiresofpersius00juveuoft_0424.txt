THE SATIRES

V. Flac. vii, 84 ff. (BU.) R. Dio
gives a very rational account of the
motives which induced Claudius to
execute this stupendous work3 which
seems to have been highly necessary
for ensuring the regular supplies of
Rome. GIF. s. Tac. An. i, 18. [“ It
is worth while to compare Juvenal’s
description of this port with the figure
it makes on the coin. The seas may
very properly be said to be enclosed
between the two semicircular moles
that almost surround them. The co·
lossus, with something like a lighted
torch in its hand, is probably the
Pharos. The two moles, that we must
suppose are joined to the land behind
the Pharos, are very poetically de-
scribed as they retire from one another
in the compass they make, till their
two ends almost meet a second time in
the midst of the waters, where the
figure of Neptune sits. The poet¹s re-
flection on the haven is very just, since
there are few natural ports better land-
locked and closed on all sides, than
this seems to have been:'' ADD‚ R.

“With shaven crowns.’' GIF. It
was the custom in distress at sea to in-
voke the aid of the deities: Jonah i, ὃς
often with the addition of a solemn vow·
to cut off the hair and offer it as an ao-
knowledgement of preservation. When
St Paul Saye, ‘⁴ There shall not an hair
of your head perish‚⁷’ Acts xxvii, 343
[xviii‚ 18 3 but s. St Matthew x, 303]
he may allude to this custom: as if he
had said ‘⁶ Vou need not shave and de-
vote your hair, for you shall be pre-
served without doing so.'’ MAD. δσκῦ

R. It was anciently supposed that the
gods would accept life for life, that the
voluntary devotement of one person
would preserve another from impending
fate3 FA Y. (s. Eur. Alc. Macr. iii,
93 AX. PR 4.) absolute forgiveness
was deemed no attribute of the heathen
divinities. As the world grew older,
it grew more foolish: it imagined that
the gods would be shuffled off with
sornewhat less than full payment3 and
this persuasion gave rise to a thousand
absurdities, such as the maiming and
