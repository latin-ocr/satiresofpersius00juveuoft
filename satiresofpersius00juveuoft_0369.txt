Mirandum est, unde ille oculis suffecerit humor·
Perpetuo risu pulmonem agitare solebat
Democn‘tus, quamquam non essent urbibus illis
35 Praetexta et trabeae, fasces, lectica, tribunal.
Quid, si vidisset praetorem curribus altis
Exstantem et medio sublimem in pulvere Circi

40 Tantum orbem, quanto cervix non sufficit ulla?
Quippe tenet sudans hanc publicus et, sibi consul
Ne placeat, curru servus portatur eodem.
