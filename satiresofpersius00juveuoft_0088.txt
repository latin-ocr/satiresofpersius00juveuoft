southampton to Guernsey, during a
fine sta-rlight night, a naval officer, who
was one of the passengers on deck, ob-
ser-ved that we were making fast for
the Portland lights. The steersman
was puzzled, as, according to the com-
pass, the course of the vessel was quite
correct. The captain was called up;
and, seeing at once, that the lights

a-head were those on the Portland
rocks, contrary to the indication of the
cosnpass, he observed the stars and im-
mediately ascertained that there was
something wrong. He ordered the
quarter-deck to be instantly cleared:
on their removing a large green parrot
in its cage,which had been standing to
the east of the compass, the needle in·
stantly righted, veering round to the
true point. The accident delayed us
about two hours.
