OF JUVENAL.

205 Dacicus et scripto radiat Germanicus auro.

Si tibi simplicitas uxoria,

deditus uni

Est auimus3 submitte caput cervice parata
F erre jugum: nullam invenies, quae parcat amanti.
Ardeat ipsa licet, tormentis gaudet amantis

210 Et spoliis.

Igitur longe minus utilis illi

Uxor, quisquis orit bonus optandusque maritus.
Nil umquam invita donabis conjuge: vendes
Hac obstante nihil 3 nihil, haec si nolet, emetur.
Haec (labit affectus: ille excludetur amicus

was put into a plate, and presented by
the bridegroom to the bride on the
wedding-night as a sort of pure-base of
her person. Sch. This custom was not
peculiar to Ruoinm Bit obtained among

many eastern nations. (Parkh. Heh.

Lex. ww), No. 3.) It also prevailed
under the name of Illotyenqabe, or
‘ morning present‚' orer a great part of
the North of Europe (moryanlc'ca ; Legg.
Longobard.) where some faint traces of
it are still to be found: and something
of the kind was customary in many
parts of England, and perhaps is so
still, under the name of‘ dow-purse.'

205. Juvenal enjoyed this allusion
(see note on 177 ;) to Domitian’s boasted
victories in the Dacian war, which vias
oue of the most dishonourable circum-
stances of his reign. He aspired to the
conductos itin person3 and, as might
have been anticipated‚ his cowardice
kept him aloof from danger, and his
voluptuousness ruinetl the discipline of
the camp: thus every thing went on ill
under his aupices. Happily fur the
army, he left it at last, having pre-
viously despatched his laurelled let-
ters to Rome3 where the obsequious
senate decreed that medals should
be struck, and statues raised to
commemorate his succes-23 and that he
should corne among them at all times in
triumphal robes. GIF. LUB. Suet.
