THE SATIRES

sA'r. 1.

Votaque deponunt, quamquam longissima coenae

Spes homini.

Caules miseris atque ignis emendus.

135 Optima silvarum interea pelagique vorabit
Rex horum vacuisque toris tantum ipse jacebit.
Nam de tot pulcris et latis orbibus et tam
Antiquis una comedunt patrimonia mensa.

608. This state of mutual dependence,
which commenced with the monarchy,
was productive of the happiest effects3
till, as riches and pride increased, new
duties were imposed on the clients:
they were harassed with constant at-
tendance, and mortified by neglect3 in
a word, they were little better than
slaves. GIF.

133. Deponere is opposed to susci-
pere. GRA.

Lonffl'sse'ma ‘retained 10 the very
last' or ‘ cherished all day long) Lu-
cian (περὶ -νῶν ἐπὶ μισθῷ συνόντων) says
of clients, δι’ ἡδονῆς ἐλπίδα μόνον πολ-
λὰς ἀηδίας ὑπομένειν and πέπεικα-ιιι αὐτοῖς
οὐδὲν ἰν ἅπαντα τῷ βίῳ πὲςα τῖἆς
ἐλπίδος, ς( 7 and 8. s. vi, 166. Un-
less the words should be transposed
thus: votaque deponunt cwnoe3 longis-
sima quanquam spes henaim, according
to the old adage, (egli-oto (lum anima
est spes est, [Cic. A. ix, 103] ‘ while
there is life there is hope) Hence it
was that to Hadrian's question ‘ What
is the longest thing θ’ Epictetus an-
swered ‘ Hope.’ R.

134. ‘ With their paltry dole they
have to buy a bunch of greens and
a little firewood on their way home3
and then they must wait till the vege-
tables are boiled, before they can ap—
pease their hunger.’

At their meals, the men used to

were originally square3 v, 23 Varr.
iv, 25. R. lt was the ancient fashion
to place before the guests tables with
the viands, and not to change the dishes
on the table. They had two tables, one
with the meat &03 the other with the
dessert. When they had eaten as much
meat as they wished, the table itself
was withdrawn, and the second course
or dessert was placed before them on
a fresh table. The square tables
went out of fashion with the triclinia.
The new—fashioned couch was of a
semicircular form called siqma, from
its shape C 3 and it held seven or eight
persons; Mart. x, 48, 5 f; xiv, 87; to
suit these, round tables were intro-
duced. As luxury advanced, the num-
ber of tables were increased (sometimes
they had a. fresh table with every course);
and the guests either remained in the
same place while the tables were
changed, or else removed to the fresh
tables3 which latter Mariial calls am·
balans ewna3 vii, 48. Both the number
and size of these tables is here noticed.
The diameter of the table, which con-
sisted of a single slab, would depend on
the size of the citron tree. And the
beauty of the wood consisted in the
number of its knots and veins. Whence
Petronius sayS, citrearum mensarum
Africa emtarum maculas mutari auro
viliori, et censum ita turbari. Their
antiquity too is not overlooked: they
had been famous in the family for seve-
ral generations. And yet amidst all this
profusiori, one single course eost a for-
tune! There seems an allusion to the
gluttony of Clodius AEsopus, the actor,
and his son. Plin. ix, 353 x, 513 Hor.
