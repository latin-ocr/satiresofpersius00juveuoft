‘ The altar at Lyons’ was at the con-
fiuence of the Soane and the Rhone,
where the abbey of Asnay now stands.
This has been Iooked upon as a sacred
spot from the earliest ages. After the
subjection of the country, the natives
built a temple and altar here to Augus-
tus, and renewed the ancient festival,
to which there was annually a great
resort. s. Dio liv3 lix, 19; Strab. iv;

Marius Priscus, proconsul of Africa,
was tried in the third year of Trajan
for extortion, condemned ίο disgorge
into the treasury about AEGOOO, and
banished from Italy. The penalty was
a mere trifle out of the vast sums he
had accumulated by his rapacity; and

the province was not [only not] reim-
bursed, [but had to pay the costs of the
prosecution: s. ROB, charles 5th p.
