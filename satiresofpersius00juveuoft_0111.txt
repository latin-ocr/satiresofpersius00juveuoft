SATJRE l.

ARGUMENT.

This Satin-e was probably composed subsequently to most of the others,
and as a kind of Introduction; it was, apparently, written at that
period of life, when the dignity derived from years and the intrepidity of
conscious rectitude entitled the Poet to assume a tone of authority.

He breaks silence with an impassioned complaint of the clamorous impor-
tunity of bad poets, and with the humorous resolution of paying them off
in their own coin by turning writer himself, 1 ff. After ridiculing the
frivolous taste of his contemporaries in the choice of such hackneyed
subjects, 7; 52; he intimates his own determination to devote himself
wholly to Satire3 to which he declares, with all the warmth of virtuous
indignation, that he is driven by the vices of the age, 19 {⁷303 523 63; 79.

He then exposes the profligacy of the women, 223 693 the luxury of up-
startS, 24 ; the baseness of informers, 32 ; and fortune-hunters, 37; the
treachery of guardians, 45; the peculation of public officers‚ 47 ; and the

general corruption of manners, 55 ; 73.

Kindling with his theme, he censures the general avidity for gaming) 87;
the selfish gluttony of the patricians, 943 135 ; their sordid avarice, 1003
1175 and the abject state of poverty and dependence in which they kept
their clients and retainers, 132. ,146.

Finally‚ he makes some bitter reflections on the danger of satirizing living
villainy, 1503 and concludes with a pretended determination to elude its

vengeance by attacking it under the names of the dead, 170.

In this as in every other satire, Juvenal's great aim is to expose and
reprove vice, however sanctioned by custom or countenanced by the great.
