Legibus antiquis castrorum ct inore Camilli

Servum, miles ne vallum litiget extra

Et procul a signis.

Justissima centurionum

Cognitio est igitur de milite; nce mihi derit
Ultio, si justae defertur causa querelae.

Tota cohors tamen est inimica omnesque manipli

consensu magno efficiunt, curabilis ut sit

Vindicta et gravior, qnam injuria.

Dignum erit ergo

Declamatoris mulino corde Vagelli,
Quum (luo crura habeas, offendere tot caligas, tot

Quis tam procul absit ab urbe?

Praeterea quis tam Pylades, molem aggeris ultra
Ut veniat? Lacrumae siccentur protenus et se

the sense will be much the same:
‘ Yourjudge will be some half-civilized
barbarian, who, from his servile and
outlandish origin, can have no sym-
pathy with freemen, and but little
respect for the rights of a Roman
citizen.’ HNN. ACH. s. vii, 116 f.
P1mire; iii, 116, note. R.

Grandes. The centurions were
chonen sor their height and strength.

The tribun al os the general was
near his own tent; ‘the benches' of
the tribunes and eenturions were by
the standards, which were placed in
the area (called principia) in the centre
of the camp. GRA. AD. The ma-
gistrates' bench was ‘ large' enough to
accommodate persons of respectability,
besides the judges themselves. E, Cl.
Cic.

15. Camillus· made this law, when
he was dictator, during the siege of
Veii. LUB. Liv. v; Plut. V. viii. PRA.

17. The whole of this is ironioal.
OW. ‘⁴ Ο nic-ely do centurions shift
the cause, When buff-and-belt men
violate the lawe! And ample (if with
reason we complain) Is, doubt less, the
redi-esa our injuries gain !’⁷ GIF.

20. Tamen ‘ to be sure,' ‘ by way of

set-off against this striet impartiality of
the judge.’

21. ‘ Their vengeance for your pro-
secution of their comrade will be matter
of serious concern, and will fall heavier
on you than the original injury.² R.
Or vindicta may be ‘ the redress which
he gets:' i.e. “The remedy is worse
than the disease.'' MA D.

23. Vaqelle‘us was an advocate of
Mutina, Sch. the modern ‘ Modena;’
PRA. and ⁴ a desperate ass.’ SPY. s.
xiii, 119. R. His foolhardiness and
obstinacy must have been shown, in
undertaking causes which no man in
liis sober senses would have advocated.

24. ‘ It would be as well to reflect,
before you go to that tribunal, how you
are to effect a retreat. Yon now have
such things as a pair of shins; and you
will then have to work your way out
through⁷ LUB. “a countless host of
hobnail'd shoes.’' GIF.

25. ‘ Who is such an ignoramus or
greenhorn? Who has seen so little of
the world P’ LUB. or‘ Who can afford
the time to leave Rome and go down
to the camp?’ R. It may be the
excuse of some friend who is applied
