Tunc grandes Galli et cum sistro lusca sacerdos
Iucussere deos inflantes corpora, si non
Praedictum ter mane caput gustaveris alli.

Et centum Graecos curto centusse licetur.

xxviii, 2 or4. The danger was in case the
shells should be pricked with a needle.
T. Many persons even at the present
day, after eating an egg, always break
the bottom of the shell; some from su-

’ perstitious motives, and others without

knowing why.

189. Στςαφιωτικῆ ἀλογία was pro-
verbial among the Geeeks. PRA. Surely
Persius has shown little judgement in
propounding his Stoical paradoxes to
such an audieuce: buthe seems to bear
a rooted dislike to the soldiery; and
whenever he has occasion for a more
illiterate and worthless character than
ordinary, he commonly repairs to the
camp for him. His conduct, in this
instance, will perhaps remind the reader
of Pielding and Smollett, who, in com· Ι
pliance with the wretched cant of their
times, manifested a patriotic abhorrence
of the military, and seldom went further ¹
for a blockhead, a parasite, or au adept
in low villainy, than the Army List.
W'e have outlived this stupid piece of
