J ure: etenim id summum, quid dexter senio ferret,
Scire erat in voto3 damnosa canicula quantum

Neu quis callidior buxum torquere flagello.

The lalus was a cuhe, (except that it
had only four flat sides τ the two others,
which were opposite, being rounded)
with figures on four of the sides 2 the
numbers were the ace (unio, or canis),
the trey (ternio), the cater (quaternio),
and the sice (senio), which was opposite
to the ace. The ace was a losing throw,
the sice a winning one: nisi parva
felicitas tibi villelm· vincere alea, et cum
aliis in unionem evolvitur, tibi semper
senionem enzeryere; Isid. xviii, 66.
· They did not play with a pair os (lice,
' as we do, but with four. Augustus in a
letter to Tiberius mentions the game:
inter coenam lusimus ysqowrmbk: talis
enim jactatis, ut quisque canem auc
senionem miserat, in singulos talos sin-
gulos denarios in mediam conferebat,
quos tollebat universos qui Venerem je-
cerat; Suet. ii, 71; [S. Hor. O. ii, 7,
25. (Sch. OQ.)] Venus was when
ace, trey, cater, and sice were thrown
at one cast: μηδενὸς ἀστραγάλου κτεσίν-τος

Ov. A. A. ii, 204 ff? Tr. ii, 471 ff: canes

four turned up the same. Herodotus

It would seem that there were different
ways of playing with the tali, as there
are a great variety of games at cards;
that of Augustus seems to have been not
much unlike our te-totum, (with the let-
ters P, T, N, H ;) for every ace or sice
they put so many sixpences into the pool
(P); caters and treys either went for no-
thing (N), or for taking up so many six-
pences; and Venus was (T) take up all.
- In the game referred to in the text, what
¹ was taken up or put down appears (as
at Loo) to have depended on the state
ofthe pool, and therefore the subjunctive
moods ferret and raderet are used.
