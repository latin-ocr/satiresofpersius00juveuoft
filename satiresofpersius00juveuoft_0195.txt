us that ‘ When Coesar went to the
public feasts, be constantly took a vomit
in the morning, with a (lt-'Slgn to indulge
himself with more keenncss, and to en-
crease his appetite sor the ensuing
feast) The fact is true; but I would
willingly believe the inference unjust.
It is more than probable that he prac-
tised this custom by the advice οἵ his
physicians, who might direct such a
regimen as the most certain and im-
mediate preservation against epileptie
fite, to which the dictator was often
liable. My honoured father (who was
excelled by few physicians in the theory
of physic) has often told me that those
kind of convulsions were of such a
nature as generally to come on aster
earing, and more riolently if the stomach
was overloaded. Caesar was so careful
in observing a decent dignity in his be·
haviour, that he dreaded the shame of
exposing public-ly this weakness in his
constitution, and therefore guarded
against it in a prudent manner, which
has since been construed into a reproach .
This surmise rests upon the stronger
foundation; as all authors agree, that
he was most stri‹tly and remarkably
abste-miuus ;'' J. Earl of Orrery, L. xiii,
p. 1631·.] Ι am eredibly informed that
a celebrated gourmand in London prac-
tised the very same means, after an
early civic feast, to prepare himself
sor a sazhionable dinner at ⁴ the west
end!

the writers about this time, especially
the younger Pliny, to signily ‘the
reign-³ ΗΕΙ.

69. It is surprising that any man of
sense should have introduced such an
abeurd idea into serious poetry3 and
yet Claudian has something not unlike
it in some high-flown Alcaics on the
marriage of Honorius and Maria; x,
13-15. Jonson too, whose learning osten
got the better of his judgement and be-
trayed him into absurdities, has cx-

panded the thought thus: “ Fat aged
carps,that run into thy net, And pilies,
now weary their own kind to eat, As
loth the second draught or cast to stay,
Ossiciously at first themselves betray;”
Forest, ii, 2. GIF.

⁶ What tlattery was ever more grossly
palpable ?’ LUB. Illi see 733 iii,

70. The metaphor is taken from a
bird, which, when proud and pleased,
‘cocks and struts and plumes itself3'
MAD. as the contrary is expressed by
the word CREST-FALLEN.

‘Nothing is too fulsome to be cre-
dited.' MAI). [Rambler No. 104.

Canute; Hume H. of E. 1028f.1

71. Such was the impious vanity of
many heathen princes ; Caligula, (Suet.
ir, 223) Aurelian, Carus, Diocletian,
Antiochus, and manyeastern sovereigns,
(curt. viii, 5 ;) Alexander of Macedon,
(Just. xi; xii. “ With ravish'd ears
The monarch hears, Assumes the god,
Affects to nod, And seems to shake the
spheres;'' DR Y, Alex. Feast, [ii‚ 17
ff] MAD.) Domitian styled himself
dominus et deus; Suet. xii, 133

Jonson, Sejanus, [act i.] GIF.

72. Quamvis lala gerat patella rhom-
bum, rhombus latior est tamen patella3
Mart. xiii, 81. PRA.

73. There cannot be astronger in-
stance of the capricious insolence with
which the tyrants of Rome treated the
servile and degenerate senate, than
their being summoned on this paltry
occasion. LUB. s. Sil. i, 6093 Liv.
ix, 17. R. There is an anecdote of
Nero, worthy, in every respect, to be
placed hy the side of that in the text.
