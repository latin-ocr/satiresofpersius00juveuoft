Paulus and Terentius Varro. Sch.

200. ‘ Betting.’ quoerit, posito
piqn ore, vincat uter3 Ov. A. A. i,
1683 T. Tert. de Sp. 16. R.

We osten find infinitives subjoined in
this manner to one or more nouns, espe-
cially in Greek: me nec femina, nec
puer, nec ε es, nec certare javat, nec
vincire3 or. Od. iv, l, 29 ff; R ib.
i, l, 19 f; ii, 49 f; Virg. AE. ix, 775
f; (in G. i, 25 f; the verb precedes ς)
Hom. 11. Ι( 174; Her. i, 543 Xen.
{ni i, 2, 27. [BY, on H. O. i, 1,-4.
202. It was almost impossible to sre-
quent the Circus without witnessing
soenes of profligaey unfit sor the eyes

i, 1354 7ος Tr. ii, 280 ff. Hence the
fathers of the church denouneed its

203. He alludes to that sun nin g of

204. ‘ And escape from the ceremony

iii, 127 and 17·2‚notes. PRA. Martial,
who had withdrawn into Spain soon

after the accession of Trajan, addi-esses
from his retirement a little poem to his
friend, which sets the misery of this
attendance in a very strong light:
(lum tn forsitan inquietus erras cla-
mosa, J uve-nolis, in Subura aut collem
domina> teris Diana> .· dum per limina
te pole11tim·um sudatrioe toya ventilat
vagumque major C'oelius et minor sati-
9a71t3 xii, 18. When we recollect our
poet's strong sense of independence‚
we are surprised that he too did not
retire from this state of slarery ; espe-
cially as he had property at Tibur,
and, probably, at Arpinum. He doubt-
less sacrificed much to the mental
pleasures, which could be found in
perfectiori only in the capital3 and in-
deed a mind like his, inquisitive, vigo·
rous, and profoundly reflective‚ does
not appear altogether suited to retire-
ment. I may mistake, but I sometimes
think Ι discover striking traits of simi-
larity between our author and Dr.
Johnson. GIF.

205. The forehead is the seat of
shame. Pers. v, 104. R. The eyes
were considered so by the Greeks. s.

to corne and take an early dinner,
which might be done with propriety ou
holidays. LUB. vi, 418 ff, notes; Tac.
An. xiv, 2 ; (L.) R. iv, 108, note.
