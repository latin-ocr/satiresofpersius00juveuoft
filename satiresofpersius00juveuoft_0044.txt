THE SATIRES OF PERSIUS.

ΕΔΤ. 1.

Sese aliquem credens, Italo quod honore supinus
130 Fregerit heminas Arcti aedilis iniquas:

Nec qui abaco numeros et secto in pulvere metas

Scit risisse vafer, multum gaudere paratus,

Si Cynico barbam petulans nonaria vellat.

His mane edictum, post prandia Callirhoen do.

pity rather than ridicule. Plat. Prot.
τοῖς διὰ φύσιν αἰσχροῖς aad: ἰτιτιμᾷ·
Arist. Eth. iii, 5. sVL. The brutal
stupidity of this piece of insolence is

’ happily dashed out at a single stroke:

“ l-lalloo! blind man!'' This is all the

, wit which the lout can muster. GIF.

[Soph. OE. R. 420.]

129. Aliquem Juv. i, 74.

Supinus, Juv. i, 66; has three dis-
tinct meanings, ⁴ indolence,’ ‘ effemi-
naey,' and ‘ pride.’ Suetonius joins
the expressions supinus, eoelum in-
tuens, and stupidus; ii, 16. Besides
which, the arrogant throw up their
heads in walking, so that their face is

'turned upwards, in much the same
,⁴ manner as if they were lying on their
backs. s. Mart. V, 8, 10; Sen. Ben. ii,
13; Ep. 803 Ov. M. vi, 2753 Cat.
xvii, 25. OS. GUR. cratera Hereu-
leunz Tirynthius olim ferre manu sola
spumantemque ore supino vertere
solebat; Stat. Th. vi, 531 ff.

sss-{gs in general. T. Plin. xxi, 109.

‘ Arezzo.' Mart. xiv, 98. PRA.

131. The abacus was a slender frame
of an oblong shape3 in the bottom of
which, counters for reckoning were
either ranged in grooves, or traversed
on graduated wires; thereby furnishing
an easy and compendious mode of cal-
ῗέῗη. GIF. ‘ Arithmetic.' LUB.

The economical saud-boards of the
· Madras School were no novelty eighteen
centu'ries ago. GIF. [s. Dutens En-

quiry‚ &c.] ‘Geometry.’ LUB. FAR.
Archimedes (homunculus a pulvere et
radim Cic. T. Q. V, 23.) KG. was
thus engaged when Syracuse was taken
and he himself fell by the hand of a
Roman soldier. Liv. xxv, [3l.] The
palace of Dionysius was quite dusty‚
from the number of mathematicians

who pursued the study of geometry

there. Plut. PRA.
133. ‘ He is ready to die with laugh-

ing if an impudent quean pluck a Cynic -

by the beard.' These philosophers were
patient under injuries and regarded in·
sults with indifference; and hence they
were exposed to many trials of temper.

Hor. S. i, 3, 133 f; MAD. Sen. de
Ira iii, 38. KG. The common women

were not allowed to show themselves ,

134. ⁷ Edictum (according to the
phrases edietum ludorum, edictum mu-
neris gladiatorii, 850. Pliny) signified
a programma drawn up by authority
and, like our play—bills, announcing
the public amusements of the day. It
was stuck up, early in the morning,
against theru-alls, where it formed
a focus of attraction for idlers and
loungers. nenio, qui parturienti filioe
obstetricem accersit, edictum et ludo-
rum ordinem perlegi& Ep. 98. MRC.

Callirhoe is just such another woeful
ditty as Phyllis and Hypsipyle. GIF.
s, Paus. vii, 21. It appears from 30 f; =
38; 51 ff ; that these mawkish lays were
recited after their dinners.

Do: thus forum putealque Libonis
mandabo sicci33 Hor. Ep. i, 19, 8 f.
