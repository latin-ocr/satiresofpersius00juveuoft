With this Satire may be compared, Pliny Ep. ii, 6; Atheuaeus vi, 5. .18;
Petronius Sat. 31 ; Lucian περ) τεῒν ἰπὶ μισθῷ amima-m: and several passages
in the old comedy of The SupposeS‚ by G. Gascoigne. GJF. R.

[“ The Indian method of giving entertainments, if judged by our notions,
is strongly marked with indelicacy. The guests all sit upon a square
carpet: the master of the feast being placed at the north-side: a number
of separate dishes are placed before him; and a different assortment less
delicate along the two sides, according to the rank of the guests.
Towards the farther end of the carpeting, the guests of inferior note Δ
are seated3 and the dishes are, before them, greatly inferior both in
number and quality:'⁷ Tennant, Indian Recreations‚ i, p. 253.

“ At their dinners (in Russia) . . . the dishes and the wines correspond in
gradation with the rank and condition of the guests. Those, who sit
near the master of the house, are suffered to have no connection with the
fare, or the tenants, of the lower end of the table3 and nothing would so
much distress a Russian prince, as sending for a portion of the soup, or
the viands, which are there placed. That, which he intends for the
gratification of the favoured few around him, is generally carried to
them; nor is it usual to ask for any thingz'’ Dr. Clarke, Trav. p. 162.
“ The etiquette of precedency, so rigorously observed at a Russian table,
prevails also in the order of the dishes and bottles arranged for the
guests. In barbarous times we had something like it in England.
Perhaps the custom is not even now quite extinct in Wales. It is
preserved in large farm-houses in remote parts of England, where all
the family, from the master to the lowest menial, sit down to the same
table: the choicest dishes are carefully plac-ed at the upper end, and are
handed down to those guests, who sit near the owner of the mansion,
according to the order in which they sit; afterwards, if any thing
remains, it is taken gradually to the rest:” ib. p 634. ΒΗΚ, C. R. i,
p. 262.

No longer back than the latter part of the last century, the claret, at an

episcopal visitation, did not go down to the curates' end of the table, but
was pushed across from the lowest rector on the one side to the opposite

incumbent.]
