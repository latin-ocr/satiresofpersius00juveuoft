The ass was a favourite of Silenus3 its
head, therefore, crowned with clusters
of grapes7 was east in brass, and fixed
upon the front of the couches on which

extraordinaxy progress in any of the

The army of Oloris, the founder of
the French mmarchy, having plundered

a ehu sch, carried off, among other sacred
utensils, a vase of extraordinary size
and beauty. On coming to Soissons,
where the booty was to be divided, and
was placed, for that purpose, in one
great heap in the centre of the army,
Clovis entreated, that, before making
the division, they would give him that
vase over and above his share. All
appeared willing to gratify the king by
complying with his request, when a
fiel-ce and haughty soldier lifted up
his battle-axe, and, striking the vase
with the utmost violence, cried out with
a loud voice, “ You shall receive no-

thing here but that to which the lot ’
