THE SATlRES

SAT. V

Qui tegitur parma et galea metuensque flagelli
155 Discit ab hirsuta jaculum torquere capella.
Forsitan impensae Virronem parcere credas.
Hoc agit, ut doleas: nam quae comoedia‚ mimus
Quis melior plorante gula ? Ergo omnia fiunt,
Si nescis, ut per lacrumas effundere bilem
160 Cogaris pressoque diu stridere molari.
Tu tibi liber homo ct regis conviva videris:
Captum tc nidore suae putat ille culinae ;
Nec male conjectat: quis enim tam nudus, utillum
Bis ferat, Etruscum puero si contigit aurum

tween the Viminal and Tiburtine gates.

Asiatic soldiery, Leo Africanus men—
tions simiam equitem ea* capra jaculandi
artificem. HNN. OLA witnessed an
exhibition of this kind ar, a fair in Ger-
many. [Vir. G. iii, 311-313.]

156. In his eagerness to lash the
guest, Juvenal now excuses the host,
and contradicts some of his former in-
vectives on the inherent meanness of
the great men of Rome towards their
dependents. Correct taste would have
led him to carry on both his purposes
together, without sacrificing one to
the other: the servility of the client
might have been exposed, while the
pride and parsimony of the patron were
preserved as qualities necessary to the
effect and consisteney of his satire.

He appears to be acting the rhe-
torician‚ and shifting his ground in order
to ronse the anger or exc-ite the hatred
of Trebius towards Virro ; by attribut-
ing the conduct of the latter to ἒπηςεα

‘The golden boss' was an amulet
adopted from the Etruscans, (who pro-
bably brought it from the east‚) and at
first was worn only by the children of
the nobility. In process of time it be-
came common, like the tria Qmina, to
all who were free-born. It wasa ollow
globule something in the sha of a
heart. This badge of liberty was worn
by the children of all ranke of freemen
