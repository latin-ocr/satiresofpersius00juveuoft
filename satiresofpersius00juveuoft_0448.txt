THE SATlRES

SA'r. xln.

Poena autem vehemens ac multo saevior illis,

Quas et Caedicius gravis invenit et Rhadamanthus,
Nocte dieque suum gestare in pectore testem.
Spartano cuidam respondit Pythia vates:

200 Haud impunitum quondam fore, quod dubitaret
Depositum retinere et fraudem jure tueri
J urando: quaerebat enim, quae numinis esset
Mens et an hoc illi facinus suaderet Apollo?
Redditijergo metu, non moribus3 et tamen omnem
’205 Voeem adyti dignam templo veramque probavit
Exstinctus tota pariter cum prole domoque
Et, quamvis longa deductis gente, propinquis.
Has patitur poenas peccandi sola voluntas.

199. This story is told at large in
Her. vi,86. A Milesian had entru-ted
a sum of money to one GlaucuS, a Spar-

tan. After a time, the sons of the Mi-
lesian came to re-demand it. Glaucus
affirmed that he had no recollection of
the circumstance, and sent thern away.
As soon as they were gone⁷ he hastened
to Delphi, to enquire whether he mjght
safely forswear the deposit. On hear-
ing the answer of the pria-item, the ter-
rified Spartan sent for the young Mi-
lesians and restored the money. Leu-
tycffides, who applies this case to the
Athenians, concludes thus ε Γλαύκου νῦν
οὔτε τι ἄτὸγσνόν ἔστι οὐδὲν, αὕτ’ ἶσα-1η oi'ae·
διμίη νομιζομένη εἶναι nonaxon· ἔιτίτριτ-
ἷξί τι τρὸῤῥιζος ἐκ Σπάρτης. Sch. GJF.
