SAT. XIV.

OF JUVENAL.

Si spectes, quanto capitis discrimine constent
Incrementa domus, aerata multus in arca

260 Fiscus, et ad vigilem ponendi Castora numi,
Ex quo Mars Ultor galcam quoquc perdidit ct res

Non potuit servare suas.

Ergo omnia Florae

Et Cereris licet ct Cybbles aulaea relinquas:
Tanto majores humana negotia ludi.

It was auciently the custom, says an
old scholiast on Thucydide& to deposit
their money in the temple for the gods
to keep. Some unlucky wight, however,
might have asked with our author on
another occasion: ‘ But who shall keep
the keepers ?' (vi, 347 f;) sor it appears
that both gods and money were some-
times swept away together! The public
treasure was laid up at Rome in the
temple of Saturn, ‘ because,' says Ma-
crobius, ‘when Saturn reigned in Italy,
robbery was nnknown.' The money
continued there pretty sare, unless from
the clutches of such mighty robbers
as Julius Caesar, since a good guard
was constantly stationed at the doors.
(whence the epithet vigil. ΒΕΘ.) In-
dividuals kept their money in the tem-

which befel this poor god, whom our
satirist,with the bitterest sareasm, dig-
nifies with the title os ‘the Avenger,'
they removed it to the temple of Castor
and Pollux. Here they were less for-
tunate than before: Mars was only
stript of his armour; but these luckless
beings, whose vigilance Juvenal also
celebrates, were absolutely flay ed;

The temple of Peace, probably y, suc-
ceeded to the credit of Castor and Pol-
lux; for when that truly magnificent
structure was destroyed by fire, in the
reign of Commodus, treasures to an
enormous amount were lost in the con-
