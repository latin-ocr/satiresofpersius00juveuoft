Vive bidentis amans et culti villicus horti,
Unde epulum possis centum dare Pythagoreis.
280 Est aliquid, quocumque loco, quocumque recessu,
Unius sese dominum fecisse lacertae.
Plurimus hic {eger moritur vigilando: scd illum
Languorem peperit cibus imperfectus et haerens

Ardenti stomacho.

Inde caput morbi.

231. ‘⁴ We asked Dr. Johnson,⁷’
says Boswell, “the meaning of that ex-
pression in Juvenal, unius dominum [α-
certae. J ohnson-Ithink it clear enough3
it means as much ground as one may
have a chance of finding a lizard upon.''
And so it does! and this, the Doctor

LUB. PRA. In the latter case, it
implies that as no one would take per—

that was quite out of the question.

metropolis, instead of that solemn still-
ness of the vacant streets, which might
suit, as in our fathers’ days, with the
sanctity of the day, the mingled racket
of worldly business and pleasure is
going on with little abatement; and in
the churches and chapels which adjoin
the public streets, the sharp rattle of
the whirliug phaeton, and the graver
rumble of the loaded wagon, mixed with
the oaths and imprecations of the brawl-
ing drivers, disturb the congregation,
and stun the voice of the preacher ;”
