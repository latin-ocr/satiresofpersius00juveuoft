SATIRE XIV.

——-

ARGUMENT.

The subjects of this Satire are of the most important kind, and the poet,
as if fully aware of it, has treated them in his best manner. In none of
his works does he take a loftier flight3 in none is he more vigorous and
energetic3 in none more clear and precise in his style, more original in
his conceptions, more happy iu his illustrations, or more powerful and
commanding m his general deductions.

The whole is directed to the one great end of self- improvement. By
showing the dreadful facility with which children copy the vices of their
parents, lff; 31 ff; he points out the neces sity, as well as the sacred
duty, of giving them examples of domestic purity and virtue. 38. .85.

After briefly enumerating the several vices of gaming, 4 f; gluttony, 6. .14;
cruelty, 15. . 25; debauchery‚ 25. .3Ο; &03 8ss ff; which youth imper-
ceptibly imbibe from their elders; 31 ff ; he enters more at large into
that of avarice ; of which he shows the fatal and inevitable consequences.

107 ff.

Nothing can surpass the exquisiteness of this division of the Satire, in which
he traces the progress of that passion in the youthful mind, from the
paltry tricks of saving a broken meal, 126. .137; to the daring violation
of every principle human and divine. 215. ,255.

Having placed the absurdity, as swell as the perplexity and danger, of 1111-
moderate desires in every pos ssible point of view, 256. ‚3314 the piece
concludes with a solemn admonition to be satisfied with those comforts
and conveniences which nature and wisdom require, and which a decent
competence is easily calculated to‘supply. 315. .326. Beyond this, de-
sire is infinite: a gulf which nothing can fill, an ocean without soundings
and without shores! 327. .331. GIF.

With the latter part of thjs Satn-e, compare Horace S. i, l; and ii, 3,
108 ff. With the former, Seneca de Ira, ii, 22; and Ep. 97. R.
