THE SATIRES Ol? JUVENAl..

1155

ECCE iterum Crispinus! ct cst mihi saepe vocandus
Ad partes, monstrum nulla virtute redemtum
A vitiis, aeger solaque libidine fortis :
Delicias viduae tanturn aspernatur adulter.

5 Quid refert igitur, quantis jumenta fatiget
Porticibus? quanta nemorum vectetur in umbra?
Jugera quot vicina foro, quas emerit aedes?

Incestus, cum quo nuper vittata jacebat
lo Sanguine adhuc vivo terrain subitura sacerdos.

depravity.’ GIF.

dear. LUB. s, i, 105 f. MAI). The
sorum of Augustus, which is llere ineant,
was the most frequented part of llome,
i, 192: therefore the purchase of pro-
