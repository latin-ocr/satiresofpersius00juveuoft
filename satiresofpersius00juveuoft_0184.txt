SAT. 111.

305 Interdum et ferro subitus grassator agit rem,
Armato quoties tutae custode tenentur
Et Pomtina palus et Gallinaria pinus.

Sic inde huc omnes, tamquam ad vivaria, currunt.
Qua fornace graves, qua non incude catenae?

310 Maximus in vinclis ferri modus, ut timeas, ne
Vomer deficiat, ne marrae et sarcula desint.
Felices proavorum atavos, felicia dicas
Saecula, quae quondam sub regibus atque tribunis

quintana domi constituta, abe· parta? et

306. When the banditti became so
numerous in any spot, as to render tra-
velling dangerous‚ it was usual to de-
tach a party of military from 1118 capital
to scour their retreats: the inevitable
consequence of which was, that they
escaped in vast numbers to Rome,

where they continued to exercise their i,

old trade of plunder and blood, and,
probably‚with more security and effect
than before. GIF. Sch. [“ The vigi-
lance of the metropolitan police appears
to have had the effect of driving into
the provinces many of the most accom-
plished London sharpers, not a fen· of
whom, there is reason to believe, are
residing at present in this town. . . More
than a dozen well-known characters of
this kind were recognized one ‘’vening
in High street3 and there have been
within the last few days some instances
of the picking ot‘ looks and of pocketS.
which indicate a degree of expertness
which scarcely belongs to our most ac-
complished Sheffield thieves.'' Sheffield

pania (posit-'jera Pomtim' zcliye'ue cwnpz}

Ap. Claudius, 441 Υ. R. then more
completely by Corn. Cethegus, 590
Υ. R. (Liv. Ep. xlvi ς) Julius Caesar in-
tended to execute this among other
public works (Suet. i, 44 ;) and Augustus
partly carried his intention into effect.
(Hor. A. P. 653 The work was re-

sumed by Trajan (Dio), by Theodoric
(Cassiod. V. E. ii. 32 f3), and in later
times by Sixtus V and Pius VI. But
after all that has been done, its vapours ’
are too ‹leleterious to admit of any per-
sons now harhouring there. PRA. GES.
