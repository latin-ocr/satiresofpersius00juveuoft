gives to the waiting· -maid the name of
one of the chaste Dian’s nymphs, ib. 72;
who attended on the person of the god-
dess, and assisted at her toilet in the
grotto of the vale Gargaphie. This· is
very humei-ons, if we consider the cha-
racter of the lady here *poken of, · she
is attended at the toilet by her filies de
chambre, who have each, like thos se
nympha, a. several offi'ee in adorning
her pereum while all these pains, to
make herself look more handsome than
usual, were because she was going to

meet a gallant. The sad condition of
poor Psecas bespeaks the violence which
she suffered, from her cruel mistress,
on every the least offence. However,
this circumstance os her torn and dis-
hevelled locks seems a farther parody
of the account which Ovid gives osone
of the attendants, who dressed the
goddess's hair: doctior illis Ismenis
