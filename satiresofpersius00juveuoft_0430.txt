SATIRE XIII.

ARGUMENT.

Calvinus had left a sum of money in the hands of a confidential person:
no uncommon thing in those days, as there were then no public banks.
This man, when he came to re-demand it, forswore the deposit. 15 f.

The utmost indignation and fury are expressed by Calvinus at this breach
of trust. ll..l5. ‘His friend Juvenal endeavours to sooth and comfort

him under his loss 7 ff.

Such is the simple foundation on which the beautiful structure before us
is raised! GJF.

The topics of consolation which the Poet employs are these. That the
fortune of Calvinus was such, that the loss could be easily borne; 7 f ;
13..16: and that such acts of dishonesty were nothing extraordinary,
amid the general depravity of the times, when a man of strict integrity
would be regarded as a prodigy. 16..74; 120..]73. This universal
corruption was owing, in J uvenal's opinion, to the absurd notions enter—
tained respecting the deities, from the opinions of the avowed atheist to
those of the practical infidel ε 75. .ll9. He proceeds to deprecate
revenge as no reparation of harm received, and as unworthy of a man
and philosopher3 174..192; to represent the stings of a guilty con—
science and the superstitious fears of the guilty as an infinitely greater
punishment than any other 3 192. ‚245 ; and to state, that if the wicked
are left to themselves, they add crime to crime, till the measure of
their iniquities is full, when vengeance and retribution infallibly over-
take them. 236. 249. R.

Juvenal is here almost a Christian: for though his ignorance of ‘⁴ that
Light which was come into the world'' (St John i, [9;]) did not enable
him to number among the dreadful consequences of impenitent guilt, the
certain punishment of the life to come3 yet, on every other topic that can
alarm or terrify the sinner, he is energetic and awful beyond example.
Perhaps the horrors of a troubled conscience were never depicted with
such impressive solemnity as in this Satire. 192. .l98; 210. .239,

Bishop Burnet recommended the tenth Satire to his clergy, in his Pas-
toral Letters: the present is not, indeed, so poetic, so fervid, so majes-
tical, as that; but, on the other hand, it enters more into the common
business oflife. All cannot be statesmen and kings: but all may be
injured by treachery3 and all have need to be reminded, that guilt some-
times finds its punishment even on this side the grave! GIF.
