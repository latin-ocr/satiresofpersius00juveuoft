Nonne vides, quanto celebretur sportula sumo?
250 Centum convivae: sequitur sua quemque culina.
Corbulo vix ferret tot vasa ingentia, tot res
Impositas capiti, quas recto vertice portat
Servulus infelix et cursu ventilat ignem.

Plaustra vehunt, nutant alt-<e populoque minantur.

Here the scene sl ists. The difficulties
of the morning are overpast, and the
streets cleared of the shoals of levee-
hunters. New perils now mise, and the
poor are obstructed iu the prosecution
of theirevening business by the crowds
of rich clients returning with their
slaves from the dole of suppers at their
patrous¹ houses. The ‘ kitchen' was a
larger kind of chafing-dish, divided into
two cells, in the uppermost of which,
they put the meat, and in the lower,
fire, to keep it warm. How often have
Ι been reminded of the sportula
(Ru-‘non iv πατρίδι· Τ.) hythe firepans and

suppers of the Neapolitans! As soon
as it grows dark, the< streets are filled
with twinkling fl’res 01· meing about in
every dir( ction on the he: ds of these
modern Corbulos, and suddenly dis-
appearing as they enter their houses
ἷίἦὴ their frugal meal. GIF. s. i, 95 f.
