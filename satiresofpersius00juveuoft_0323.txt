ARGUM ENT.

ln this Satire, in which Juvenal puts 011 a most serious and iuiprcssive air,
he demonstratos that distinction ismerely pcrsonal; 19. .3Ο; that though
we may derive rank and titles from our aucestors, yet if we degenerate
from the virtues by which they obtained them, we cannot be considered
as truly noble. l..l=>·; 30..38. We estimato anirnals not from their
pedigree but froin their excellencies. 56..67. Merit constitutes true
nobility3 30 ff; 211 ff3 in this, 111811 of inferior origin are frequently
pre-erninent; :39 11“; and in this, men of high birth ought to aim at dis-
tinction. 68. ,δᾶ

Τ118 Satire. branchos out into many collateral topics. From the profligacy
of the oung nobility, he pass-es, by an easy transition, to the miserable
state osy the provinces, which were usually placed under their manage-
ment, and which they plundered and harassed without mercy. 87 ff ; (s.
Plin. Ep. to Max. viii, 24.) This part of his Satire is treated with a
fieedom of thought, and an elevation of language, worthy of the best
times of the republic.

From this, he returns once more to the main subject, 142 ff ς the state of
debasement into which the descendants of the first families had volun-
tarily sunk: 145 ff; 118 severely lashes their meanness, cowardiffli, and
base prostitution of every kind; 183..210; vices which he sets in the
strongest light, by contrasting them with the opposite virtues, to be
found in persons of the lowest station and the humblest descent. 231 ff.
Seneca is placed iu contraposition to N ero3 211. ,23οε &icero with
Catiline and Cethegus 011 1118 0118 hand, and Octavius on the other 3
231. ,2442 Marius with Catulus; 245. .253. The Decii 254. .258; and
Servius Tullius 259 f; are then adduced. And lastly the noble traitors
of the house of Brutus are contrasted with the patriotic slave; 261 . .268.

considered as a whole, this is a very fine performance. We may perhaps
discover a triteness in some of these latter instances; but perhaps the
poet was willing to sacrifice novelty to notoriety, and imagined that his
examples would be more effectual in proportion as they were more
generally recognised.

He winds up with the reflection‚ that 01 1118 two it is far better by persona]
merits and exploits to throw a splendor around a low origin than to
sully the highest by degenerate vices. 269. .271. And the most ancient
Roman ancestry, after all, was of a very questionable character in point

of respectability. 272. .275.

The detailed history of N ero’s enormities shows this Satire to have been
written while they were yet fresh in the author's mind, probably before

the death of Vespasian. (see note on 51.) GIF. R.

Horace has handled the same subject (Satire i, 6.) more methodically and
in a less declamatory style. KG. There is an excellent German trans-
lation of this Satire by von Denis. R. Boileau Despreaux has given a
version of it, (Satire v‚) which, though almost literal, is very inferior to
the original. A CH. To these may be added ‘⁴ I-ligh Birth. a Satire ad-
dressed to a young Nobleman; in imitation of the Eighth Satire of
Juvenal. Loudon. 1821.” 8vo. pp. 48.
