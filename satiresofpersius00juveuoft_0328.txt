THE SATIRES

SAT. vlu.

Quis enim generosum dixerit hunc, qui

Indignus genere et praeclaro nomine tantum
Insignis? Nanum cujusdam Atlanta vocamus,
AEthiopem Cycnum, pravam extortamque puellam
Europen ; canibus pigris scabiequc vetusta

:35 Levibus et siccae lambentibus ora lucernae
Nomen erit Pardus, Tigris, Leo, si quid adhuc cst,

Quod fremat in terris violentius.

seh. The Egyptians worshipped him
under the figure of a live ox, which he
was supposed to animate. When the
animal (to which they gave the name
of Apis, LO.) grew old, and conse—
quently-unfit for the residence of the
divinity, he was thought to quit it, and
migrate into a younger body of the
same species3 just as the Tartars‚ with
infinitely more good sense, are taught
to believe that their Lama migrates
from one human body to another. The
deserted ox was drowned with much
ceremonious sorrow; when, those me-
lancholy maniacs, his priests, attended
by an immense concourse of people,
dispersed themselves over the country,
wailing and lamenting, in quest of the
favoured individual which Osiris had
selected to dwell in. This the priests
were supposed to know by some sacred
marks, and this they always took care
to find in due time: the lamentations
of the people were then changed into
songs of joy3 they conducted the sa-
erosanct beast with great pomp to the
shrine of his predecessor, shouting and
calling to the inhabitants as they passed,
“ We have found him, we hare found
him! come, and let us rejoice together.''
All the rites of the Egyptians were of
a gloomy cast. This may be one of the
causes of the singular attachment of the
women to them, wherever they were
introduced. We have seen (vi, 526 ff;
PRA.) in what manner the priests of
Isis ran up and down the streets of
Rome, howling and lamenting for
Osiris: this was a paltry imitation of
their native ceremonies3 to the clamo-
rous termination of which Juvenal here
alludes. GIF. MAD. Her. iii, 27
