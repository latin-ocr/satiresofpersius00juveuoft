Pausan. i, 42. This was said to yicld
a sound, like that of a harp, when the
rays of the rising sun fell upon it. It
was also said that the sound was cheer-
ful in the morning, and melancholy at
sunset, resembling a plaintive human
voice. Callist. Stat. i, p. &91; ix, p.
901. According to some the statue
was broken in halves by an earthquake ;
Strab. xvii, p. 1170 f; others set it down
as one of the frantie impieties of Cam-
byses Memnon, the son of Aurora
and Tithonus, is symbolical of the sun.

has been covered by the sand for many
ages: it is that part which yet remains
on its pedestal, which performs the
wonders mentioned by so many tra—
vellem, who have perpetuated their cre-
dulity on the spot by inscribing their
names on the stone. [Ithas been brought
to London, and may be seen in the
gallery of the British Museum. Α W.]
One man, indeed, of high respectability,
bears a kind of testimony to the common
report of a sound proceeding, not from
‘the harp' of Memnon (for there never
was any such thing), hut from the statue.
Strabo says he heard a sound3 but
whether it camesrom the colossus itself,
or the base, or from some one of the
numerous standers by, he could not
tell. “ Indeed,'' adds he, “ one would
be inclined to suppose almost any thing,
rather than to believe stones, however
disposed, capable ofproducing a sound.'⁷
Germanicus too, according to Tacitus,
was indulged with the same favour. If
he listened with patience to the non-
sense first read to him by the priests,
he was not unworthy of it. Even Sa-
vary, who saw nothing but prodigies in
Egypt, treats this foolish affair as an
artifice of the priests. The sound pro-
bably proceeded (as PW thinks) from
an excavation near the plinth, the
sides of which might be struck, at a
concerted moment, with abar ossonorous
metal. The fiction however does very

well in poetry: “ As Merunon's rnarble
harp, renown’d of 0111 By sabling Nilus,
to the quiveriug touch Os Titan's ray,
with each repulsive string Consenting,
sounded through the warbling ¹‹iir Un-
bidden strains3'' Pleas. of Imag. On
discovering his mistake respecting the
harp,Akenside altered the passage thus:
·‘ As Memnon's marble form, renown'd
of old By sabling Nilus, at the potent
touch Of morning utter’dsrom itsinmost
