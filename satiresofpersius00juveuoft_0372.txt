THE SATIRES

65 “ Pone domi lauros, duc in Capitolia magnum
Cretatumquc bovem: Seianus ducitur unco

Spectandus: gaudent onmes.

Quae labra? quis illi

Vultus erat? Numquam, si quid mihi credis, amavi
Hunc hominem.” “ Sed quo cecidit sub crimine? quisnam

“ Nil horum: verbosa et grandis epistola venit
A Capreis.” “ Bene habet; nil plus interrogo. Sed quid
Turba Remi?'' “Sequitur Fortunam, ut semper, et odit

si singulos ictus sanquis dolorque se-
queretur: nemo tam temperans gaudii,
seroeque laetitioe, quin instar ulcionis
videretur cernere laceros artas, truncata
membra, postremo truces horrendasque
imaqines abjectas &emptasque flammis,

65. To understand the little drama
which follows, we must suppose one of
those who had witnessed the commence-
ment ofSejanus's punishment, hastening
home to announce the intelligenee, and
prepare his public demonstrations <f
loyalty and joy. The dialogue passes
between him and his neighbours. s. vi,
47-52. GJF.

The verb (lucere applies both to vic-
tims and to culprits. Ov. M. xv, 114.

After the executioner had fitted a
hook in the throat, the body was dragged
by the populace to the Gemonian steps
on the Aventine Hill, and, when the
vengeance of the mob was sat-ed, thrown
into the Tiher. SVL. MAD. Suet.

71. Dio (lviii, 4-8 3) sneers at the
length ofthis epistle: Suetonius(iii,55;)
calls it pmlemla miserandaque oratio.
The truth is, that Tiberius (who, like
Cromwell, was always too cunning to
be clear) was at this time confounded
by his fears, or at least pretended to be
so; and therefore wrote ‘⁴ about it, and
aboutit.” Suetonius has preserved 3
sentence of this memorable address
which fully justifies the character he
has given of it. Among other things,
Tiberius besought the senate to send
one of the consuls, wath a military
guard, to conduct him, a poor and de-
solate old man, in safety to their pre—
sence! Jonsou in his Sejanus has fabri-
eated ‘ a verbose epistle’ for Tiberius,
with a masterly hand; [act v.] GJF.
R. Nervius Sertorius Macro, who was
appointed successor to Sejanus as pre- l
fect of the praetorian hands, was the
confidential bearet of this epistle. SVL.
