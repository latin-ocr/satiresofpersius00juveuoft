OF JUVENAl..

Tota licet veteres exornent undique cerae
20 Atria, nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus.

Hos ante effigies majorum pone tuorum:
Praecedant ipsas illi te Consule virgas.

Prima mihi debes animi bona.

Sanctus haberi

Agnosco procerem.

Salve, Gaetulice, scu lu

not their own, They'd burn their titles,
and their tombs defaee, And disavow
the vile, degener-ate race: For fame of
families is all a cheat, ”sis personal
virtue only, makes us great;'' De Foe,
quoted from memory. GIF.
