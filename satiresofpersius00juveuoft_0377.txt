Sanguine causidici maduerunt rostra pusilli.

Cicero was murdered by the second
triumvirate. Antony, whom Juvenal
supposes to have been particularly
irritated by the second Philippic, de-
&55552‘330223ishrffvssissspssffgel}¹5}
to the sea-side. He made no resistance,
but looking sternly on the leader, C.
Popilius Lenas, whose life he had
formerly saved, and thrusting his neck
as foi-ward as he could out of the litter,
he bade him take what he wanted.
The ungrateful wretch cut off his head
and his hands, and carried them to
Antony, who rewarded him for the
agreeable present with a civic crown!
and a large sum of money. The head
was fixed on the Rostra, between the
two hands, (where, as we find from
Florus, the people ran as eagerly to see
his relies, as formerly to hear his elo-
quence,) a piece of impotent revenge,
which, not long after, recoiled on the
author of it. Speaking of Antonius

the grandfather of the triumvir), who
ell in the bloody proscription of Sylla,
Cicero has an observation of striking
singularity: in lais ipsis rostris in
quibus ille rempublicam constantissime
consul defenderat, positum caput illud
suit, a quo erant multorum civium

⁴* How fortunate a natal day was
thine, In that late consul a te, O Rome,
of mine !'' This, line or some one like it,
was made the subject of ridicule during
the author’s life: he was not, however,
ashamed of the sentiment, for he repeats
itin prose: Ο nonae Decembres .' quae
me consule fiel-stis, eqo diem vere nata-
lem hujus urbis, &03 Or. for Flac. In
the second Philippic, after severely re-
torting upon Antony, he adds, nec vero
tibi de versibus respondebo .· tantum
dicam breviter neque illos, neque ullas
te omnino literas no'sse. This is “ the
reply churlish, when, instead of answer-
ing an adversary, you disable hisjudge-
ment:'’ what he subjoins, however, is
a noble apology for his lighter studies.
It may be doubted whether Cicero's
poetry, generally speaking, deserves
the epithet (ridenda) which Juvenal is
pleased to affix 1ο it: the verse in
question, indeed, has long been the jest
of small wits, and even the “ mousing
Martial hawks at it;'’ but there are
many vigorous and elegant passages
scattered amongst his works : after all,
perhaps, it was the me consule, and not
the -natam natam, the vanity‚ and not
thejingle, of the verse which prox-oked
the sneers of his contemporaries. When
