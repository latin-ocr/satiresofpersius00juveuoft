The poet has shown no great adroit-
nese in allowing this third speaker
(Bestius) to break in rudely upon the
dialogue, when he might, with better
effect, have put all that was about to be
said into the mouth of his op ponent.GI F.
This illiterate fellow, (Hor. Ep. i, 15,
37 f 3) however, ‘ commences an attack
on the philosophers' as having caused
all the mischief by inculcating the doc-
trine of liberality and other expensive
habits. PRA. The many corruptions
introduced at Rome, after the conquest
of Greece, brought the natives of that
country into great odium with the
sternet Romans. In the indiscriminate
antipatby towards all that was Grecian,

volved. e. Juv. vi, 16, 291 ff3 iii, 60, ff;
