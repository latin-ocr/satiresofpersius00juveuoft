THE SATlRES

sAT. xiu.

Et qui nec Cynicos nec Stoica dogmata legit
A Cynicis tunica distantia, non Epicurum
Suspicit exigui laetum plantaribus horti.

125 Tu venam vel discipulo committe Philippi.
Si nullum in terris tam detestabile sactum
Ostendis, taceo; nec pugnis caedere pectus

121. Antisthenes was the founder of
the Cynic sect, and Zeno of that of the
Stoics, which was in fact but a branc'n
of the Cynic; with which it accorded as
regards morals. Sch. LUB. s. Pers. i,
133; iii, 53. PRA.

122. The Stoics wore tunics under
their gowns, the Cynics waistcoats
only. SM. s. Hor. Ep'. i, 17, 25 ; PRA.

123. He was the first who introduced
the fashion of having gardens to town-
houses. Plin. xix, 4. PRA. [“ When
Epicurus to the world had taught 1hat
pleasure was the chiesest ζ010011ς (And
was perhaps i'th' right, ifrightly under-
stood ;) His life he to his doctrine
brought, And in his garden’s shade
that sovereign pleasure songht ;'’ Cow-
ley.] In his own diet, he was very
simple and abstemious, Sen. Ep. 21;
living upon herhs and bread and water.

(ΡΑ.) Stat. S. i, 3, 94; Virg. Cir. 3.
(SCA.) R. No one could hold the
theologica] tenets opricurus in greater
contempt and abhorrence than Juvenal,
and yet he never omits an opportunity
of doing justice to the simplicity of his
life. This is the more laudable, as few
have lain under greater obloquy (from
the dissipated lives of his followers) than
this philosopher, who, to say the least
of him, was no ordinary man. He has
been represented as wallowing in sensu-
ality. He placed, it must be eonfessed,
the chief good in pleasure ; but 110
mea-nt by it, that calm and soothing
delight which arises from a life spent
in the contemplation of virtue. Diocles
says that he was a perfect example of

continence and simplicity 3 and Juvenal
loves to dwell on his frugality z parvis
suffecit in lcorte's. In a word, the gar-
den of Epicurus was a school of tem-
perance, and would have afforded little
gratification, and still less sanc-tion. to
those sensualists of our day, who, in
turning hogs, fiatter themselves that
they are beeoming Epicur-cans ἔ After
saying thus much of the man, it is but
just to add a word respecting his doc-
trines. With regard to the beauty of
temperance and sobriety, and the strong
necessity of restraining 1110 tumult-aeus
and disorderly passions, Epicurus may
be listened to with advantage3 but on
the higher and more important subjecte
of life, there is not a more false and
destructive system on earth than his ;
nor one so likely to make mankind worse
by imitation. Perhaps he is the only
philosopher, who never had one follower
like to himself. Decipit ememplar vitiis
induebam Hor. Ep. i, 19, 17. All his
imitators were vicious, and the old
world was ruined by his virtues. GIF.
MAD. [“ On ηε εςαηνοὶί pas dire
assez de bien de l’honne'tete de ses
moenrs, m* assez de mal de ses
opinions sm· la religion ;'' Bayle: s. also

124. ‘ Yours is not such a desperate
case! FA Y. [Ov. P. iii, 4, 8.]

125. ‘ Yon may be bled by the

{pperzntffjtss second-rate practitioner.’

126. Hor. S. ii, 3, 41. R.

127. ‘ Exhibit all the signs of frantie
grief) Claud. xv, 135. (HS.) R.

129. Itis still the practice to close
the doors and windows of one's house

as a signos deep mourning. Seh. LUB.
