Pinguis aqualiculus propenso sesquipede exstet.
O Janc, a tergo quem nulla ciconia pinsit,

55. Janus, fortunately for him, had
a double face, and these eyes in his
poll prevented him from being laughed
at behind his back. L UB. The Romans
were great adepts in the various arts
of contempt3 and their descendants,
the modern Italiam, have inherited no
small portion of their ingenuity. They
will frequently follow an unfortunate
wight occipiti ecem), [in. maa‘imo metu.
malum et eoeczcm eorpus ad hostes ver-
tere, Sal. J. 1153] and ridicule him
with the most expressive and ludicrous
signs. ‘ The ass’s ears' and ⁶ the stork’s
bill' are still the popular modes of scoff-
ing: these, the supple-mess of their
fingers enables them to imitate with
great success3 but the manner of it
must be seen to be fully understood.
The following is an evident imitation
of this passage: ne credas laudatoribus

accommodes ; qui quum te adulationibus

64. A metaphor from statuaries who
run their nail over the marble to ascer- .

Sid. Ap. ix, 7. ‘The joining is so
exact as to allow the critical nail to
glide uninterruptedly along the po·

The Romans were exceedingly parti-
cular in having their t‘urniture, whether
of wood or marble, so construeted as to
leave the joints imperceptible, not only
to the eye, but to the scrutiny of the
nail; if in passing it over the line of
juncture, the slightest jar were per-
ceived, the fastidious taste at once
condemned the article as unfashionable.
In a much earlier and less luxurious
