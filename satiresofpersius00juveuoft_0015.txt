Stoicism,which had infected poetry even in Cicero's days,
had subsequently spread with amazing rapidity. Its general
prevalence might be owing to the increase of profligacy, sor
which it furnished a convenient cloak. Not that such a
remark applies to Persius, though brought up in this school:
for he practised most scrupulously the virtue which he recom-
