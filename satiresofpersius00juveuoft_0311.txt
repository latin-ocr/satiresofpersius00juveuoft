trit-k succeeded but ill with AEmilius's

habit (if ignorant of a point of law) of imitatore, s.129 ff; asit seldom happens

referring to learned nien of rank, such as
the Scaevolae, διο. Under the succe-§sors
of Augustus, there was not the same
encouragement for these great men to
atudy that science; therefore the orators
were obliged to adopt the Grecian me-

126. This vagary of AEmilius (in
choosing, though a man of peace, to be
represented on a war-horse) seems to
have taken mightily at Rome, most
probably from its absurdity, and to have
had a number of imitators. Martial‚ in
an attach upon an unfortunate peda-
gogue for interrupting bis sleep, (note
on 222 3) compares the noise of his
school to that of the hammers and anvils

that any hut the author of a joke profits
by it. GIF. PRA. s. 143, note. [de-
