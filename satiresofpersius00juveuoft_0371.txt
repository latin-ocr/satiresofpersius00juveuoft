OF JUVEN AL.

Quosdam praecipitat subjecta potentia maguae
Invidiae3 mergit longa atque insignis honorum
Pagina3 descendunt statuae restemque sequuntur.
Ipsas deinde rotas bigarum impacta securis

60 Caedit et immeritis franguntur crura caballis.
Jam stridunt ignes, jam follibus atque caminis
Ardet adoratum populo caput et crepat ingens
Seianus: deinde ex facie toto orbe secunda
Fiunt urceoli, pelves, sartago, patellae.

58. ‘ A bras-s plate attached to the
statues of eminent persons and contain-
ing a pompous enumeration of their
titles and honours! Sch. Similar plates
, are affixed to the back of the stalis in
· St George's Chapel‚ Windsor, with the

61. Many statues os gold, as well as
of bronze, had been erected in honour
of :EliusSejanus3 (who held the offices
of prefect of the city, Sch. and captain

of the praetorian hands: Suet. iii, 553
563 &03 Tac. A.iii;) these were melted
down as soon as he was disgraced.
LUB. PRA.

62. Cujus statuis saera faciebant,

que Tiberii collegam appellabant, non

perim Xiph. Tib. Tac. A. iv, 2, end;

63. This instance is most happily
chosen, since it exhibits at one view,
the instability not only of court, but
of popular favour. No subject erer
ascended to such a height of power3
none ever fell from it so rapidly into
the abyss of ‹lisgrace and ruin. This
picture of the unfeeling and barbarous
versatility of the mob has seldom been
equalled sor truth and humour. With
respect to Sejanus, it may be said of
him, as it was of Lally‚ by Voltaire;
“ he was one against whom every man
had a right to list his hand bnt the
executioner.’' During the full tide of
his prosperity, nothing seems to have
been too low sor his malice. Even the
obscure and inoffensive Phaedrus, pa-
thetically complains of having been un-
justly acc-used by him: (iii, prol.) he
survived, however, both the accusation
and the accuser, and in his story of
Princeps Tibicen, gently retorts upon
the fallen fortunes of his adversary.

Thus Rutilius Gallicus, prefect of
the city, is called prooeima (Germanico)
cervix ponderis immensi; Stat. S. i, 4,

64. Pliny gives a very interesting
detail of the impotent vengeance exer-
cised on such statues by the rabble:
juvabat illidere solo superbissimos vul·
tus, instare serra, saeve're securibus, ut
