C. Gracchus were transferred to the
equestrian order, then by the Livian

knights, afterwards by C. Sulla they
were restored to the senate, and lastly

234. This absurd curiosity about
trifles (which, as Seneca well observes,
nec javat nec prodest scire) was but
too common among the ancients. Gel-
lius gives us many pleasant instanees
of it, to which his learned translator
has added more. Juvenal seems to
