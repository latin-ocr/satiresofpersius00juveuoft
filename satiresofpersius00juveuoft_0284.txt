SAT. vl.

Et genus humanum damnat caligo futuri.
Praecipuus tamen est horum, qui saepius exsul,
Cujus amicitia conducendaque tabella
Magnus civis obit et formidatus Othoni.

560 Inde fides arti, sonuit si dextera ferro
Laevaquc, si longo castrorum in carcere mansit.
Nemo mathematicus genium indemnatus habebit:
Sed qui paene perit, cui vix in Cyclada mitti

of Honorius (unless it be merely the
poet's fiction); et cladum taciti rupere

but different names of the same person.
BU. Ε. The professors of astrology
were alternately banished and recalled,
perseeuted and cherished. as the events
they predicted were prosperous or ad-
verse to the fortunate candidates for
power. That they were the occasion
of frequent commotioris among this am-
bitious and credulous people, cannot be
doubted3 and Tacitus says of them
with equal truth and spirit, lcoe gemes
hominum potentibus infidum, speranti-
bus sallaoe, quod in civitate nostra et
vetabitur semper, et retinebitur3 H. i,
22; ii, 62 3 A. ii, 323 xii, 523 Suet.
iii, 36; ix, 14. R. GIF.

558. Ptolemy accompanied Otho into
Spain and there predicted that he
would survive Nero. From his success
in this instance (says Tacitus) he took
com-age and ventured to predict his
elevation to the empire. Otho believed

it (or rather affected to believe it), and
from that moment he determined to
work the destruction of Galba. In the
dreadful soenes which followed, Ptolemy
was a principal actor. GIF. LUB.
The effect of such predictions on an
ambitious spirit is finely exemplified in
the tragedy of Macheth. “ ’Tis strange:
And oftentimes, to win ns to our harm,
The instrumente of darkness tell us
truthS, Win us with honest trifles, to
betray us In deepest consequence;”

561. In stationary camps (answering
to our barracks) there was a black-hole
in which malefactors were eonfined;
