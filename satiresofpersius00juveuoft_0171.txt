“The sacred nature of the conjugal
relation is entirely merged in the
worldly aspect of it. 'l'hat union,
sacred, indissoluble, fraught with :ill

as to moral qualities, than persons so
situated would make. God's ordin-ancos
are not to be so mocked3 and such
violations ofhis laws are severely visited
upon offenders against them ;'’ woman‘s
