OF JUVENAL.

(Damnat enim tales habitus3 sed damnat et odit)
Nec galea faciem abscondit: movet ecce tridentem,
Postquam librata pendentia retia dextra

‘205 Nequidquam eil'udit, nudum ad spectacula vultum
Erigit et tota sugit agnoscendus arena.
Credamus tunicae, de saucibus aurea quum sc
Porrigat et longo jactetur spira galero.
Ergo ignominiam graviorem pertulit omni

Libera si dentur populo suffragia, quis tam

Perditus, ut dubitet Senecam praeferre Neroni;

207. The Retiare'e' wore only a tunic :

208. These priests also wore a conical
cap, which tied under the chin with long
gold hands. Liv. i, 20; Dionys. H. ii, 70.
His appearing in such a conspicuous
dress was a greater proos of effrontery.

was reported at Rome, that the con-
spirators, after having made use of Piso
to desti-oy Nero, intended to make away
with Piso himself, (“ For what should
we gain,’'said the chiefofthem, Subrius
Flavius, “ by exchanging a harper for
a tragedian ?'' alluding to Piso's having

It in to this circumstance that Juvenal
alludes. If the conspirators really
entertained such an idea, they were the
weakest of men3 for Seneca (to say
nothing of his age and infirmities) was

too unpopular to have held the undis-
turhed possession of the empire for a
day. With respect to Seneca, it is his
fortune to have been “at the fair of
good names, and to have bought a
reasonable commodity of them;'' for,
exclusive of our author, who evidently
thought highly of him, and appears to
have been a very diligent reader of his
works, several ancient writers have
been lux-ish in his praise. Yet we shall
look in vain into the history of his life
for any extraordinary number of virtu-
ous or praiseworthy actions. His first
exploit was corrupting the daughter of
Germanicus, for which he was driven
into banishment3 and from the obtrusive
and never-ending boasts of the mag-
nanimity with which he endured it, it
may be conjectured that Ovid himself
did not bear his exile much more im-
patiently than this impassible Stoic.
He flattered Claudius3 and still more
grossly bis favourite, Polybius, in order
to obtain his recall; and, as soon as he
had suceeeded, forgot the latter, and
betrayed the former. He then 'oined
the virtuous Nero (whom he too care
to supply with a mistress) in his perse-
eution ongrippina, his greatpatroness3
and when her son, not long afterwards,
put her to death, he was more than
suspected of drawing up the palliating
account of it. A better moralist than
Seneca bath said, “ He who maketh
haste to be rich,shall not beinnocent;''
Proverbs xxviii, 20. This was notorious-
ly our philosopher's case. Juvenal gives
him the epithet os praedive33 x, 16.
Dio attributes the insurrection of the
Britons, in a great measure, to his
