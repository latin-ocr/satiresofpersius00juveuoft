SATJRE lv.

ARGUMENT.

In this Satire, which was probably written under Nerva, Juvenal indulges
his honest ‘spleen against two most distinguished culprits; Crispinus, ¹
already noticed in his first Satire, 1. .27; and Domitian, the constant
object of his scorn and abhorrence, 28. . 149.

The sudden transition from the shocking enormities of Crispinus, 1. ‚103
to his gluttony and extravagance, ll ff ; is certainly inartificial, but
appears necessary in some degree to the completion of the Poet’s design‚
the introduction of Domitian, 28.

The whole of the latter part is excellent. The mock solemnity with which
the anecdote of the enormous turbot is introduced, 37 ff; the procession,
or rather the rusb, of the affrighted counsellors to the palace, 75 ff; and
the ridiculous (lebate 119 ff; (as to whether the fish should be dressed
whole or not, 1303) which terminatos in as ridiculous a decision, 136 ff;
(that a dish should be made for it, 131 ; according to the sage advice of
Montanus)—all show a masterly hand.

We have, indeed. here a vivid picture of the state of the empire under the
suspicions and gloomy tyranny of Domitiam of his oppressive system of
espionage and rapacity, of his capricious severity and trifling, and of the
gross adulation in which all classes sought a precarious security.

Many masterly touchcs are given in the brief allusions to the character

' and conduct of the chief eourtiers as they pass in review: the weak hut
well-meaning Pegasus, stoic, and bailiff of Rome, 75 ff; Crispus the
complaisant old epicure and wit, 81 ff; Acilius, and his ill-fated young
companion, 94 ff ; Rubrius the low-born ruffian, 104 ff; Montanus the
unwieldy glutton, 1073 Crispinus the persumed debauchee, 108 f;
Pompeius the merciless sycophant, 109 f ; Fuscus the luxurious and
incompetent general, 111 f; Catullus the blind hypocrite, extravagant
in his praises of the finny monster, 113 ff 3 and Veiento the timeserving
fortune-tener, 113; 123 ff.

And we cannot but admire the indignant and high-spirited apostrophe,
with which our Poet concludes, reflecting on the servile tameness of the
patricians as contrasted with the indignantvengeance of the lower orders,
150. ,1543 an apostrophe which under some of the emperors would be
fatal, and under none of them safe. GIF. R.
