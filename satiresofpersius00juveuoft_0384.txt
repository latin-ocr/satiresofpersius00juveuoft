THE SATIRES

190 Sed quam continuis ct quantis longa senectus
Plena malis! Deformem ct tetrum ante omnia vultum
Dissimilemque sui, deformem pro cute pellem
Pendentesquc. genas et tales adspice rugas,
Quales, umbriferos ubi pandit Tabraca saltus,

Poet. L. Min. t. vi; Pha. vii, 5o;
Hor. A. P. 169 ff; contrasted with Cic.
de Sen. R. In this striking description
of old age, Juvenal seems to have
thought of a passage in Crates, thus
admirably rendered by Cumberland:
“ Hard choice, for man to die, or else
to b'e Thattottering, wretched, wrinkled
thing you see. Age then we all prefer3
for age we pray, And travel on to life' s
last lingering day; Thens siukingslowly
down from worse to worse, Find heaven' s
extorted boon our greatest curse.'' But
indeed the idea is sufficiently obvious,
and has had good things said on it iri
every age3 here is one of them:
“ Some comfort We have in dropping
early—we expire, And not without
men's pity3 to live still, Have their
good wishes, thus, too, we prevent
The loathsome misery of age, beguile
The gout and rheum, that in lag hours
attend For grey approachers;'’ Two
Noble Kinsmen. Againj “For as our
age encreases, so vexations, Griefs of
the mind, pains of the feehle body

Rheums, coughs, catarrhs, —we ’re but
our living coffins; Besides, the fair
soul’s old too; ‘²⁷ Wife for a Month.
And Sp enser, in a stanza of sui-pas sing
beauty, “ O ⁷ywh do wretched men so
much desire To ydraw their days unto
the utmost date Ρ And do not rather
wish thern soon expire3 Knowing the
miseries of their estate, And thousand
perils which them still awate, Tossing
them like a boat amid the mayne:
That every hour they knock at Deathe’s
gate; And he that happiest seems, and
least in payne, Yet is as nigh his end,
as he that most doth playne.'' GIF.
[“ This is old age: but then, thou
must outlive Thy youth, thy strength,
thy beauty; which will change To
wither'd, weak, and gray3 thy senses
then Obtuse all taste of pleasure must
foregO, To what thou hast; and for
the air of youth, Hopeful and cheerful,
in thy blood will reign A melancholy
damp of cold and dry, To weigh thy
spirits down, and last consume the
balm of lifez⁷⁷ Milton, P. L. xi, 558-
