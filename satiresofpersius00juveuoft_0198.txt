THE SATIRES

SAT. 1v.

95 Cum juvene, indigno, quem mors tam saeva maneret
Et domini gladiis tam festinata: sed olim
Prodigio par est in nobilitate senectu83
Unde fit, ut malim fraterculus esse gigantis.
Profuit ergo nihil misem, quod cominus ursos

Figebat Numidas, Albana nudus arena
Quis enim jam uon intelligat artes

Patricias? Quis priscum illud miretur acumen,
Brute, tuum? Facile est barbato imponere regi.
Nec melior vultu, quamvis ignobilis, ibat

95. Who this young man was, is
doubtful. Dio gives an account of one
Acilius Glabrio, who was put to death

even women, entered the arena, either
voluntarily or by compulsion, (see 95,
note) for the emperor's amusement3 ii,

by Domitian for impiety (attachment 143 ff3 viii, 192 ff, i, 22 ff. R.

to ‘ Jewish customs,' perhaps Chris-
tianity), and because he had fought in
the arena: for when he was consul
(Trajan was his colleague, and they
were both young at the time‚) Domitian
sent for him to Alba and compelled
him to engage a lion at the celebration
of the Juvenilia: he killed the beast3
and, some time after, the tyrant put
him to death, through envy of the ap-
plause he had then obtained3 lxvii, 13.
