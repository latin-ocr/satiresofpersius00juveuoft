120 Hic tamen infodiam: ‘ Vidi, vidi ipse, libelle:
Auriculas asini quis non habet ?’ Hoc ego opertum,
Hoc ridere meum, tam nil, nulla tibi vendo

Iliade.

Audaci quicumque afflate Cratino,

Iratum Eupolidem praegrandi cum senc palleS,
125 Adspice et haec, si sorte aliquid decoctius audis.

Inde vaporata lector mihi ferveat aure :

Non hic, qui in crepidas Graiorum ludere gestit

Sordidus ct lusco qui possit dicere, Lrscss!

120. ‘ Here in my book will I bury
the secret! C'S.

Infodiam was more applicable to the
ancient than to the modern mode of
writing. Juv. i, 63, note. MAD.

121. Quis non habet ,θ We have here
the sentence complete, which was com-
menced but abruptly suppressed at 8.

κ’ · LUB. Midas was gifted with asinine

ears for the bad taste he betrayed in
delivering judgement on Apollo's min-
strelsy. PRA.

122. Hoc ridere for lianc risum; s.
9. MAD.

⁶ Such a mere nothing! s. 2. KG.

123. ‘Not for that Iliad you so
highly prize.’ GIF. s. 4. LUB. [S.
BUR, on AE. P. V. 1004.]

‘ Inspired by bold Cratinus' with
the contempt of folly and the hatred of
vice. OS. Eupolis atque Cratinus
Aristophanesque poetoe atque alii, quo-
rum comoedia prisea virorum est, si
{zif‘iff‘&isauria-0?{zifz‘zssff
rius aa} alioqui famosus, multa cum
libertate notabant ; Hor. S. i, 4, 1. .5.
Persius mentions the three in chrono-
logical order. Cratinus carried his
boldness so far, that it was found

j necessary to restrain his personalities

’ by a special edict. He flourished before

“ the Peloponnesian war, and lived to the

. age of nearly a hundred. s· Luc. Macr.

'⁶ t. iii, p. 227; Ath. i; Eus.Chron.Quint.
κς V. Pat. i, 16. PRA. GIF.

124. The anger of Eupolis was
directed against the pestilent dema-
gogues who were the curse of his
country. s. Cic. Att. vi, l. PRA.
Why the youngest of these dramatists

J is called praeQndis senex, is uncer-
ἶ tain. [Cic. Or. m‚43; Hor. A. P. 80.]
, He lived, however, to be nearly severity,

and is styled the prince of the old
comedy. PS W. Cleon and the minions

‘of the people lived in awe of him:

G-IF. and the fame of his writings
had excited an interest even at the Per-
sian court. MIT.

Palles: 26, note.

126. Deeoetius ⁴ less crude3' a meta-
phor from fruits, LUB. or from wine or
other liquors reduced by boiling. Virgil
is said to have composed fifty lines or
more every morning, and in the evening
to have cut them down to ten or a
dozen. materiam volo primum esse vel
abundantiorem, vel ultra qnam
oporteat susam: multum inde deco-
q nent anni, multum ratio lineabit,
aliquid vel ipso usa detentum Quint.
xi, 4; PRA. s. 45 f. MAD.

126. ‘ Let my reader glow with an
ear warmed by their strains.’ PRA.
This passage accounts sor the constant
succession of new speakers in Persius.
Horace and Juvenal profess to imitate
Lucilius3 while our youthful poet took
for his model the old comedy, and
therefore threw his satires into the
dramatic form. W’hatever his reason
might have been, he certainly secured
vivacity and freedom by his choice;
and though his success might not be
great, yet his ambition is not to be ’
censured. GIF.

127. The Greeks were distinguished
by the sandal (cr-elgizla) or slipper (solea),
as the Romans by the shoe (calceics):
Gell. xiii, 103 sapiens crepidas sibi
numquam nec soleas feeit ; sutor tamen
est; Hor. S. i, 3, 127 f; PRA. Suet.
iii, 13. KG. The quantity of ονξέ idas
is changed from xgnaeffioef. BA . To
ridicule national peculiarities of dress
is a proof of a low and vulgar mind.
