Nominis et tituli, quantum non Leueade, quantum
Thessaliae campis Octavius abstulit udo

Caedibus adsiduis gladio.

Sed Roma parentem,

Roma patrem patria: Ciceronem libera dixit.
245 Arpinas alius Volscorum in monte solebat
Poscere mercedes alieno lassus aratro,
Nodosam post haec frangebat vertice vitem,
Si lentus pigra muniret castra dolabra.
Hic tamen ct Cimbros et summa pericula rerum

Atque ideo, postquam ad Cimbros stragemque volabant,
Qui numquam adtigeram majora cadavera, corvi,

244. Cicero was the firstwho received
this title by adecree osthesenatemvhich

The title was indeed given to Au-
gustus and afterwards to several of his
successore: but Cicero was the first

‘ free Ron1e;’ the only circumstance,

of any value. Libera is used with the
same feelings in 211, ‘if choice were
free! lt must have been these flashes

of uncontrollable indicnatimi at the
fallens state of his country, and not a
sareastic compliment toa favourite
‹lancer‚ that occasioned his removal
from Rome. GJF.
