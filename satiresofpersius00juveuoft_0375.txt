Principis angusta Caprearum in rupe sedentis

Cum grege Chaldaeo? vis certe pila, cohortes,

Posse volunt.

Sed quae praeclara ct prospera tanti,

Ut rebus laetis par sit mensura malorum?
Hujus, qui trahitur, praetextam sumere mavis,

Frangere pannosus vacuis ,Edilis Ulubris?

lviii. R. It may seem a little extraor-
dinary that Tiberius, who, at a somiei-

eri0d,had driven the astrologers out ot·
glabr, nay, put some of them to death,
should in the decline of life, have se-
eluded himself from the world to en-
'0y their society without molestation;
imt his conduct may be aeeounted for,
from the condition of human nature.
[⁸. 1 Samuel xxviii, 7-12.] The mul-
tiplied cruelties that followed the sall of
Sejanus, though they could not appease
the ferocity, had yet alarmed the con-
science, of this execrable monster: an-
guish and despair took possession of all
his thoughts; and, if we could sor a mo-
ment suppose the damned permitted to
make their “ eternal blazon to ears of
flesh and blood,'’ (Shaksp. Ham. i, 5 ς)
we could not image terms of deeper
horror for them, than those with which
he begins one of his letters to the senate:
Quid scribam vobis, P. CK? aut quo-
modo scribam? aut quid omnino non
ecribam, hoc tempore? clii me deoeque
petius perdant, quam quotidie perire
sentiment-io. Suet. iii,67. In this state,
afflicted at the past, dissatisfied with
the present, and trembling for the fu-

ture, his enseebled and distracted mind
clung for relies to the wretched impos-
tures of astrology, which it had formerly
rejected; and endeavoured to divert the
evils of to-day, by vague and senseless
researches into the destinies of to-mor-
row. The strange inconsisteney of
atheism has been elsewhere noticed3
Tiberius is a striking proof of it. GIF.

lights to make himselfmerry at the ex-
pense of the plebeiun ediles. They
were ehosen, as their name imports,
out of the commons, and had the care
of weights and measureS, of markets
and provisions, the determination of
petty easeS, the inspection of the roads,
the overseeing of the theatres, &cz In
little municipalitieS, they were probably
the only magistrates. We have nothing
precisely like them in this country;
but in the Italian villages, they still r
subsist, as ragged and consequential as ³
