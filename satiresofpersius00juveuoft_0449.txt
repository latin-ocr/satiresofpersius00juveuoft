OF JUVENAL.

4‘27

Nam scelus intra se tacitum qui cogitat ullum,

210 Facti crimen habet.

“ Cedo, si conata pc1·egit?”

Perpetua anxietas ncc mensae tempore cessat,
Faucibus ut morbo siccis interque molares
Difficili crescente cibo: sed vina misellus
Exspuit; Albani veteris pretiosa senectus
215 Displicet3 ostendas melius, densissima ruga
Cogitur in frontem, velut acri ducta Falerno.
Nocte brevem si forte indulsit cura soporem

909. If the second foot of a Latin
hexameter is a single word, a spon·
dee is only admissib'e in the instance
of the prepositions inter and intra fol-
lowed by the word they govern z as here,
and in Lucr. v, 9573 i, 909. In fact,
the preposition and its case may be con-
sidered as a compound word, and
are osten written so in mss. We have
other examples of this in interea, prce-
terea, nobiscum, quatenus, and, iu our
own language, in WITHAL, usnam,
‘mnam-o, &c. Fascio. Poet. ed. 2nd,
P N either Thales, nor Chrysippus, no,
nor his great master Zeno, ever taught,
or even conceived doctrines of such pure,
such sublime morality as are here de-
livered: doctrines, iu short, which the
light of nature alone was incapable of
discovering: and which the author uu—
doubtedly derived from that“truelight‚’'
[St John i, 9;] which now began to
glimmer through the Roman world,
and by which many sineere lovers of
truth and virtue already began to direct
their ways, while they were yet uncon-
scions of the medium through which
they received the illumination. With
respect to the passage before us, it is
not heatheuism. It is not to be found
iu the recepts of theirgravest teachers:
and essvated as the morality of our au-
thor confessedly is, it is diffie-ult to ima-
gine that it could soar so far above the
ethice of his time, without the assist-
ance which has been spoken of. What
is more, this was the peculiar boast of
Christianity. It was the vantage ground,
on which its first professore stood, and
proclaimed aloud the superiority of their
saith: Eeknici, scelera admissa punitis ,·
apud noe et cogitare peccare est: vos
conscios timetis, nos conscientiam, ᾅϊ ·

212. He becomes severish from anx-
iety of mind. One symptom of this in-
ward sever is a dryness of the mouth
and throat, owing to the want of a due
secretion of the saliva, by the glands
appropriated for that purpose. The
great use of this secretiori is in masti-
cating and diluting the sood, and making
the first digestion thereof; also to lu-
bricate the throat and oesophagus, in
order to facilitate deglutition, which,
by these mean-⁸3, in healthy persons, is
attended with ease and pleasure. But
the direct contrary is the case, when
the mouth and throat are quite dry, as
in severs. The food is chewed with
difficulty and disgust, and cannot he
swallowed without uneasiness and loath-
ing, and may well be called dg'fficilis
cibus in both these respects. Wanting
also the saliva to moisten it, and make
it into a sort of paste, it breaks into
pieces between the teeth, and taking
up more room than when in one mass,
it fills the mouth as if it had increased
in quantity, and is attended with a
nausea, which still increases the un-
easiness of the sensatiou. MAD.
