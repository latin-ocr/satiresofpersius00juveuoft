‘⁴ Proser Galla caput.'' “ Noli vexare, quiescit.”
Ipse dies pulcro distinguitur ordine rerum:
Sportula, deinde forum jurisque peritus Apollo
Atque triumphales, inter quas ausus habere

Cujus ad effigiem non tantum mcjere fas est.

wife's name. MAD.

With iuquit understand maritus.

126. ‘ Put out your head,' says the
dispenser‚ (because this was ‘ a stale
triek' nota ars). ‘ Don't disturb he1·;'
says the husband; ‘ I dare say, she is
asleep) LUB. Or the whole line may
be assigned to the husband only.

127. The ordinary routine ofthe day’s
employment is made much the same by
Martial; prima salutantes atque al-
te ra continet hora. Eser-cet raucos
tertia causidicos. In quintam va-
rios eoetendit Roma labores: sexta
quies lassis, septima finis erit. Sus-
ficit in nonam nitidis octava palae-
stris: imperat exstructos srawere
nona loros. Hora libellorum decima

Arabarches. There is much un-
certainty here both as to the text, and
as to the person intended. He may be
either (1) Crispinus (26), who was
created Prince of Arabia by Domitian,
Schol. MS. He might also be called
‘ the Arch-Arabian,' sarcastieally, as
worst of all the Arab slaves. LUB. or
(2) Tib. Alexander. who was governor
of Egypt, brother or nephew of Philo

Judaeus, procurator of Judaea, and a
Roman knight. Tac. H. i, 113 ii, 79;

granted a triumphal statue. Hieronym.

word itself, it is doubted whether it
should be Arabarches or Alabar-
clees; [“ AEthiopians: not that re-
mote nation beyond Egypt, but those of
Arabia Petrea, a wild, theevish, and
servile nation, such as now inhabit
those parts, base, bloody, and theevish

their neighbours, and so by the Is-
raelites their neighbours accounted at
that day :” POL, Ann. on Amos ix, 7.

classes of patron and client com-
prehended nearly all the citizens of
Rome. A patron was a man of rank
and fortune, under whose care the
meaner people voluntarily put them-
selves, and, in consequence of it, were
denominated his clients. 'Ibe patron
assisted his client with his influence
and adviee; and the client, in return,
gave his vote to his patron, when he
sought any office for himself or friends.
The client owed his patron respect; the
patron owed his client protection. The
early Romans threw a sanctity around
this obligation on the patron’s part. It
was expressly enforced by a law of the
Twelve Tables: patronus si clienti
fraudem feeerit, sacer esto. Virgil,
many ages after, places the unjust
patron in Tartarus, among the violators
of natural and moral decorum: hic qui-
bus invisi fratres, pulsatusve parens,
el frans innexa clienli; [Ε. vi,
