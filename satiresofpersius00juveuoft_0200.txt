178 THE SATIREs

SAT. lv.

Qui numquam visae flagrabat amore puellae,
1 15 Grande et conspicuum nostro quoque tempore monstrum!
Caecus adulator dirusque a ponte satelles,
Dignus, Aricinos qui mendicaret ad axes
Blandaque devexa> jactaret basia redae.

His shrewdness was shown by ac—
eommodating himself to the tyrannical
caprices of Domitian. ΕΑΒ.. 111 the
reign of Nero he was banished for pub-
lishing a jeu d'esprit‚ which he called
‘ Codieils ofpersons deceased,’ in which
he had libelled senators, and priests,
and even the emperor himself. LUB.
Tac. A. xiv, 50. (L.) PRA. He was
‘prudent’ enough to obtain the good
grace of Nerva likewise. When that
prince was supping with a small party,
Veiento lay in his bosom. The eonver-
sation having turned on the enormities
of Catullus, the emperor exc-laimed, “ I
wonder what would be his fate, were
he now alive ?'⁷ 44 His fate,’' replied
Junius Mauricus, (casting his eyes on
Veiento, who was little less criminal
than Catullus,) 44 his fate,''1·eplied he,
with the dauntless spirit of an old Ro-
man, “would be——to sup with us.’'
GIF. Plin. Ep. iv, 223 ix, 13. R.
Catullus Messalinus had well earned
the epithet here given him: luminibus
captus, iugenio soezvo mala coecitatis ad-
diderat ; non verebatur. non erubescebat,
non miserebatur: quo α Domitiano non
secus ac tela, quoe et ipsa eoeca et im-
provida feruntur, in¹ optimum quemque
contorquebatur3 Plin. Ep. ir, 923
FAR. D. Cass. lxvii3 Joseph. B. J.
p. 996 f3 Tac. Ag. 45. R. His death
may be added to the innumerable in-
stances of retribution which “ vindicate
the ways of God to man.'' He was
affiicted with an incurable disease,
attended by the most excruciating and
unremitting torture: yet the agonies of
his body were perfect ease, compared to
those of his mind. He was constantly
haunted with the thoughts of his past
cruelties; the ghosts of those he had
accused seemed ever before him, and
he used to leap from his bed with the
most dreadful shrieks, as if avenging
dames had already seized upon it.
Worn out at length by his mental
sufferingS, he expired one livid mass of
putrefaction! GIF. ς. Her. iv. 205.

the proverb: ἔκ τοῦ ὂρᾶν γίγνεται τὸ ἐρᾶν.
LUB. Mart. viii, 49. R.

ingens, cui lumen ademptum3 Virg.

⁶ Even in our time, when they are so
rife.' L ΠΒ.

l 16. He was probably not quiteblind:
otherwise his praise of the turbot could
not have pleased the tyrant. ACH.

4 Raised from a beggar's station on
some bridge to be the accursed minister
of cruelty.' MAD. xiv, 134. Thus sa·
telles amlacioe, potestatis, scelerum,
&a Cic. Cat. i, 33 Agr. ii, 133 Prov.
33 Quint. 25. R. Unless these words
are rather to be conneeted with the
following: dignusque qui dirus &a
‘ the importunate sentry of the bridge.’
PRA. s. v, 8.

117. The Aricine hill, without the
city gate on the Appian road, swan-med
with beggars, particularly Jews; Sch-
iii, 296; so as to become proverbial for
it: multi Manii Arieiae. s. Pers. vi,
563 Mart. ii, 19, 3: xii, 32, 10. R.
As the carriages went slowly down hill,
they were the more exposed to the im-
portunities of mendicants. T. The mo-
dern name of Aricia (Hor. S. i, 5, 13
MAD.) is ‘ la Riccia,' PRA. or
‘ Nemi.’ R.

118. ‘ To throw his complimentary
kisses to the ladies, as they rode in
their chariots down the hill,' Sch. ‘ by
kissing his hand! SM. iii, 106; MAD.

Hosea xiii, 2. Whence the expression
adora re. R. Livy xxx, 16 f. ED.
