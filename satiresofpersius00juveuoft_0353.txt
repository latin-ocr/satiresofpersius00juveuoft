SATIRE IX.

——a——

ARGUMENT.

This Satire relates to that most execrable practice in which the anciems,
to their eternal shame, so universally indulged. J uvenal's purpose was
to impress the minds of others with the same loathing which 110 himself
felt for this disgusting vice.

The Satire consists of a dialogue between the Poet and one N aevolus, an
enfranchised slave; a poor wretch, who, from a kind ofjester or dabbler
in small wit for a meal, had become what is called a man of pleasure;
and thence, by a regular gradation, a dependent of a wealthy debauchee,
who made him subservient to his unnatural passions: and in return,
starved, insusted, hated, despised, and discarded him! 27. .9Ο.

solate appearance, l..26; and by an affected ignorance of the cause,
engages 111111 to enter into a detailed account of his infamous life. 27 ff.

This piece 1135 many beautiful and many moral passages, exclusive of the
grand and important 1055011 which it is our duty to gather from it ; that
alife of sin is a life of slav ery3 102 ff; that those who embrace it
for the sake of profit, are deluded 111 their expectations from day to day,
till in age they sigh to 110 emancipated from that state. of misery which
they voluntarily adopted, and from which, while they view it with eyes
of anguish and despair, they have no longer strength or resolution to
fly: 123 ff. ‘¹ Therefore‚'’ in the words of Divine VVisdom, “ they shall
eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices ;”
