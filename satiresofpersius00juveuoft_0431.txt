4. This can only be understood by a
reference to the judicial forms of the
Romans. In criminal causeS‚ the prae-
tor urbanus, who sat as chief judge,
put into an urn the names of his asses—
sms, (a kind of jmymen, who, to tlte
amount of some hunck-eds, were annually
chosen for this purpose,) from which he
drew out the number prescribed by law,
usually about fifty, who sat by him at
the trial. When the pleadings were
over, they retired, and deliberated on
what had passed. On their return,
they had each three waxen tablets put
into their hands, one of which was
marked with the letter c for condemno,
‘ guilty 3' another with the letter A for
absolvo, ‘ not guilty ;’ and the third

’ with the letters N 1. for non liquet,

‘ Ι am doubtful‚’ or ‘ not proven.’ One
of these tablets each person dropped
privately into the um, which was then
brought to the praetor, who took them
out, and pronounced sentence according
to the deeision of the majority. In this

the guilt of the offender, he endeavours
to moderate the passionate transports of
his friend. In what follows, he bas

7. Tenuis: [s. Her. V, 30, 51.]

8. The metaphor is taken from a
ship’s sinking by being overloaded.
MAD. But in that case, the greater
the jactura the less would be the
danger of sinking: damna levant3

10. A metaphor from a ‘ well-worn'
path. LUB.

In acervo the metaphor is perhaps
