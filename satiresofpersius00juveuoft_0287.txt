SAT. Vl.

OF JUVENAL.

‘2155

Atque aliquis senior, qui publica fulgura condit.
Plebeiuui in circo positum est et in aggere satum.
Qum nullis longum ostendit cervicibus aurum,

590 Consulit ante phalas delphinorumque columnas,
An saga vendenti nubat caupone relicto.

Hae tamen et partus subeunt discrimen et omnes

Nutricis tolerant fortuna urguente labores3
Sed jacet aurato vix ulla puerpera lecto.

place was struck by lightning, a priest

the spot, with due solemnity. A two-
year-old sheep was then sacrificed, and

out the general extravagance of the

the extremity of indigence amongst
them by the want of a gold chain.

⁴ The dolphins' on the columns were

perhaps owing to the Circensiau gamos
being originally consecrated to Consus

parties 111 the Circus, the Blue, the
Green, xi, 196; the white, and the
Red, vii, 114; (to which were added
by Domitian, the Golden, and the
Purple. Suet. xii, 7; Xiph.) Ofthese the
Blue and the Green were the principal
ones: for to them the others were re-
spectively attached. The egg was the
badge of the Green faction or that of
the land, the Dolphin of the Blues
or the sea party. The symbols were
so managed as to show which of the
two parties was winuing. The Romans
being generally but little connected
with maritime affairs, the Green was
the popular colour; xi, 196: though
the other was sometimes the favourite
with the emperor. In silver coins of
Roman families, under chariots of two
or four horses, we sometimes find a
trident, sometimes an ear of corn: it
is not improbable that these may be
emblems of the two leading parties
above mentioned, and denote the vic-
torious eolour. FE.
