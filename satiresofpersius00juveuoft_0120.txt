THE SATIRES

Flaminiam 3 (puer Automedon nam lora tenebat,
Ipse lucernata: quum se jactaret amicae)
Nonne libet medio coras implere capaces
Quadrivio? quum jam sexta cervice seratur

65 IIinc atquc inde patens ac nuda paene cathedra

dum &m (s. Tae. An. i, 7 ;) i. e.because
he has been Nero⁷s charioteer. HK.

· 61. ‘ The Flaminian Way,⁷ the most
ancient and celebrated of all the Roman
roads, led tothe emperor’s villa. It was
made by the censor C. Flaminius (Y.
R. 533) through Tuscany to Ariminum.
Strab. v, p. 333. s. Suet. ii, 303 PRA.
R. [viii, 145; A W, p. 98.]

This ‘boy’ was the charioteer of
Nero, as ‘ Automedon' was of Achilles.

ri, 223 viii, 148. Cicero, also, uses
Automedon as the name of any cha-
rioteer3 Rosc. Am. 35. PRA. R. [Ov.
A. A. i, 5. ...8]

62. By ipse we are to understand
Nero: MAD. for ipse, [33; Theoc.
xxix‘, 503 (nn.)] as well as ille (97),
αὔτός, [St Mark xiv, 153 443] and
ἐκεῖνος, osten convey a notion of au-
thority and respect3 hence a teacher
is thus spoken ofby his disciple,(as in the
Pythagorean expression αὐτὸς ἐ’φα,
[whence nullius addictus jurare in
verba nmgistri, Hor. E. i, l, l4; (nn.)
Liv. xxii, 53, 10; is as much as to say
‘ Ι am not the man to take matters on
any one’s ipse diatim or to pin my
saith on any one's sleeve :³ S. ·Ter. Eu.
ii, 2, 32 3]) a master by his servant,
[Hom. Il. Z 18 3] a general by his
soldiers‚ [Cic. C. ii, 2, 43 Liv. vi, 25,
3 ; vii, 14, 3 ς] a patron as distinguished
from his clients, the mind as contrasted
with the body, [men as opposed to
brutes, Hom. 11. A 513] &a in which
cases the opposition shows what is
meant. r, 30; Flac. iii, 1503 Or. Tr. V,
1, 453 Calp. i, 463 R. Liv. xxii, 1, 2'3
xxvii, 32, b.

Jactare se is ‘to play the agreeable'
or ‘to show off before.' It may be a
metaphor from a peacock spreading his
tail3 s. Pers. iv, 15; R. [Liv. iii, l, 4.]

Though spoken of in the feminine

gender, Sporus the eunuch is here
meant; BRI. whom this monster cum
dote et flameo, nuptiarum celeberrimo
efficio, deductum ad se, pro uxore lta—
bue't5 quemque, Augustarum orna-
mentis ea‘cultam lecticaque vectum, et
circa conventus mercatusque Graeciae
ac mom Romae circa Sigillaria comi-
tatus est identidem ea=oseulam3 Suet.
vi, 28. PRA. s. sponsoe turpes; 78.
R. A few years afterwards this Sporus
was ordered by the emperor Vitellius to
personate a nymph in a pantomime,but
committed suicide to avoid appearing
on the stage in a female dress! GIF. ”
The epithet lucernata implies that this
was not a woman, lacerna being a man's
cloak. FE. It was worn by soldiers
in the camp, Plin. xviii, 253 Ov. Fast-
ii, 746 3 and by spectators in the amphi-
theatre 3 in the latter case it was white,
AX. Mart. xiv, 137 3 iv, 2. See also
Suet. ii, 403 v, 6; PRA. Mart. v, 8.

63. Cerne are the same as ceratoe
tabellce. The pocket-books of the Ro-
mans consisted of thin pieces ‘of wood,
covered over with wax, on which they
wrote with the point of an instrument
called stylus, the other end of which
was blunt for the purpose of erasure.
Hor. S. i, 10, 72. MAD.

(34. ‘ In the very cross-ways 3' such
is the impudence of these misereants,
and the depravity of these times ! L UB.

The litters of the rich were called
hemplzori, Mart. ii, 81 ; iv, 51 ; or
octoplzori, vii, 141 ; from the number of
hearers or lecticarii ; persons of inferior
fortune used sella ,qestatoria ‘ a sedan,'
carried by two chairmen. ix, 142; L.
MAD. R. s. BOE, c. 8, 427 ἲς 443 f.

65. Here ‘the litter’ is left ‘ open on
both sides' out of effrontery, as opposed
to lectica tecta pelle veloque and sella
clausa3 1243 Mart. xi, 98, 11 ff3
L UB. clausa lectica fenestra 3 iii, 242 3
clausum latis specularibus antrum3

cubiculum viatorium3 Plin. xxxvii, 2;
