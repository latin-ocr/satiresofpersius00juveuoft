175 Audet in historia: constratum classibus isdem
Suppositumque rotis solidum mare: credimus altos

Defecisse amnes epotaque flumina Medo
Prandenteset madidis cantat quae Sostratus alis.
Ille tamen qualis rediit Salamine relicta,

180 In Corum atque Eurum solitus saevire flagellis
Barbarus, sEolio numquam hoc in carcere paSSOS‚
Ipsum compedibus qui vinxerat Ennosigaeum?
Mitius id sane, quod non et stigmate dignum

Credidit.

Huic quisquam vellet servire deorum?

185 Sed qualis rediit ἓ, Nempe una nave, cruentis
Fluctibus, ac tarda per densa cadavera prora.
Has toties optata exegit gloria poenas.

178. Of Sostratus the poet nothing is
known. The extrav-agant ssights of his
fancy appear to have been influeneed
by his copious libations to the god of
wine. LUB. GRA. s. xv, 47. R. The
meaning may be that Sostratus flew
heavily and was unable to soar (Hor.
Od.iV, 2, 27 ς) from his wings being sur-
charged with moisture ; HEI. not with
what is vulgarly called “ h e a vy we t.'’
There is indeed a favourite English
Bacchanalian song in which a threat is
held out, if old father Time is caught,
“ In rosy wine to dip his wings 3²² but
the latter interpretation seems more
