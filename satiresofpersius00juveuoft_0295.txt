SATIRE VII.

ARGUMENT.

This satire was probably written in the early part of Domitian's reign.
It contains an animated account of the general ‹liscouragernent under
which literature laboured at Rome. Men of learning had, in fact, nunc
but the Emperor, to whom they could look for patronage. l. .37.

Beginning with P oe try, 30 ff. it proceeds with great regularity through
the various departments of H i s t ory‚ 98 ff; L aw, 106 ff? O ratory,
R he tor ic, 150 ff; and G ram m a r ; 215 ff.- interspersing many curious
anecdotos, and enlivening each different head with such satirical,hu1nour-
ous, and sentimental remarks, as naturally flow from the subject. GJF.

As for Poe try; many of the rich nobles were poetasters themselves, and
rewarded a poem vn‘th a song ; 38 f: the utmost stretch of their muni-
ficence was to lend a tumble-down out-house, for the poet to fit up for
his own recitation: 32..49. But poetry and poverty can 'never
flourish in the same soil. 50. .97.

As for Law ; the only artifice by which Lawyers could get into practice,
was by pretending to be above the want of it; even though such trickery
often ruined them outright. 106. .l49.

But none were more to be pitied than the poor drudges who had to keep
school, 150 ff. They, after wasting their time upon dunces, 159 ff ; and
suffering the pranks of incorrigible boys, 213 f ; got nothing but blame
that their pupils did not prove paragons of genius and gentility. 158 f.
The education of children seemed the only point in which parents were
niggardly; 178. ‚188: and even the little which they spent on this, they
would not part with, till wrested from them by legal process, 228 f.
And the Grammarian, unless he were a thorough proficient in philology‚

history, mythology, διο. &c. would never have a single day-scholar.
229..243. R.
