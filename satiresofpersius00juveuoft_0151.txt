Juvenal describes the world of spirits
aspenpled by the figments of the poets;
the circumstances he has not invented,
but selected; and it does not follow,
that, because he believed in a future
state. he therefore gave credit to such
absurdities. We may attribute the
sketch he has given to bis satirical
turn, which he could not forbear in-
dulging to the disparagement οῖ’ his
argument. Virgil, to whom our author
is here plainly alluding, does not give
avery dignified narrative of his hero’s
passage over the Styx: AE. vi, 411. .
416. Such puerilities excite our pity;
especially when we think how incom-
parably sublime is the description of the
state of reprobation, in Holy Writ, as a
place ‘⁴ where the wormdieth not and tbe
fire is not quenched :'’ St Mark ix, 43 f;
while of the state of blessedness the
Apostle says, “ Eye hath not seen, nor
ear heard, neither have entered into the
heart of man, the things which God
hath prepared for them that love him.'’
1 Corinthians ii, 9. GIF.

152. The common people, when they
went to a bath, paid the bath-keeper a
brass coin, in value about a halfpenny.

were, paid nothing. Sch. Mart. iii, 30,

153. ‘ But bc thou persuaded that
these things are true.’ The language is
too emphatic for a mere supposition.

155. The Fabii, who had taken the
Veian war upon themselves, were cut

At Cannae in Apulia, Hannibal
gained his fourth and greatest victory,
defeating two consular armies, and
slaying 40,000 of the Romans, in-
cluding AEmilius Paullus one of the
consuls, and so many of the equestrian
order, that three bushels of gold rings
were sent to Carthage in token of the
victory! PRA. [Livy xxii, 47 ff.]
