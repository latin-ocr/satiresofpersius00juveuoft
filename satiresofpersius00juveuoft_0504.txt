THE SATIRES

SAT. XVI .

Digredimur lentaque sori pugnamus arena.
Ast illis, quos arma tegunt et balteus ambit,
Quod placitum est ipsis, praestatur tempus agendi
50 Nee ros adteritur longo sufflamine litis.
Solis praetcrea testandi militibus jus
Vivo patre datur: nam, qum sunt parta labore
Militia), placuit non esse in corpore census,

Omne tenet cujus regimen pater.

Ergo Coranum,

55 Signorum comitem castrorumque aera merentem,
Qumnvis jam tremulus, captat pater. Hunc labor aequus
Provehit et pulcro reddit sua dona labori.

47. A metaphor from the amphi-
theatre, LUB. ii, 144. MAD.

50. “ Nor are theirwealth and pati-
ence worn away By the slow drag-chain
of the lavv's delay3'' GIF. viii, 148.
PRA. [“ Sir, you were saying, if I
mistake not, nn hour or two agO, that
soldier-s have the speediest justice. I
agree with you in that3 for they are
never without rell-dress :'’ Dr Sheri-
dan’s Art of Punning, R. 13. A wit
of this description might translate cei·-
vina senectus, xiv, 2513 ‘a harty
old-age.’]

51. Militibus liberam testandi facti-
onem ]Jre'mus quidem D. Julius Ccesar
concessit ; sed ea eoneessio temporalis
erat: postea vei-o D. T itus dedit.- post
hoc Domitianus .· postea D. Nerva

PRA. This privilege, however, only
applied to the savings of their pay, and
their other military earnings 3 peculium
castrense. Sch. MAD. The object of
this enactment was obviously to con-
ciliate the soldiery, the attachment of
whom was now become of importance
to the ambitious chiefs who contended
for the empire. By the old constitution
of the republic, the power of a father

⁷ over a son was unbounded3 it extended

both to his property and to his person,
and terminated only with the death of
one of the parties· We do not find
many instant-es of the abuse of this
power. Natural affection is an ex—
cellent corrective to the anomalies of
tyranny. GRA. [Livy i, 50, 5.]

53. ‘ Incorporated with the private
fortune-⁷ MAD.

54. Coranus, in all probability, was
a soldier of fortune well known at that
ti1ue; LUB. not the wealthy individual
whom Horace mentions3 S. ii, 5, 57;
64. PRA.

56. The arts of common fortune-
hunters h ave been already satirized ; xii,
93 ff: R. but there is something ludi-
erous, anlid the disgusting picture of
avarioious depravity, in making asather,
tottering 011 the verge of the grave, pay
servile court to a son, in the full vigour
of life, in hopes to be named his heir!
GIF. At the same time we must
recollect that this son was in the army,
and consequently that his life was of a
very precarious tenure. [οὒὸεὶς οὕτως
ἀνόητός ἔμ’-τι, ὅστις πόλεμον πρὸ εἰρήνης

soldier, when going into battle, to name
an heir in the presence of three or four
witnesses, and if he fell, the law recog·

57. To say labor reddit sua dona
labori is surely a very awkward ex-
pression and not very intelligible:
and, from what follows, the promotion
is to be attributed to the diseernment
of the general. Labor is probably
