THE SATIRES

SAT. 1.

SEMPER ego auditor tantum? numquamne reponam,
vexatus toties rauci Theseide Codri?
Impune ergo mihi recitaverit ille togatas,
Hic elegos? impune diem consumserit ingens
5 Telephus? aut summi plena jam margine libri

1. [Virg. G. iii, 1 ff3 Lord Byron,
English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.]

The Romans were in the habit of
reciting their literary productions either
in private circles,or in public assemblies.
Tne latter were held sometimes in the
temple of Apollo, sometimes in spacious
mansions, either hired, or lent for the
purpose by a wealthy patron, who ex-
pected the attendance of his clients and
dependents to swell the audience and
applaud the author. s. vii, 403 Pers.
prol. 73 Hor. S. i, 4, 73; MAD. S. i,
3, 863 E. ii, 2, 67. A very picturesque
passage of Pliny describes the listless-
ness which pervaded such meetings:
lente cunctanterque veniunt, nec tamen
permanent, sed ante finem recedmzt;
alii dissimulanter etfetrtim, aliz· simpli-
citer et libere3 E. i, 13; GJF. PRA.
E. ii, 14. R.

Reponere is a metaphor taken from
repayment of a deht incurred: possum
jam repetere recessum, et scribere ali—
quid, quod non recinat& ne videar,
qnorum recitationibus misici, non audi-
tor fuisse, sed creditor: nam ut in
ceteris rebus, ita in audiendi officio,
perit ‘qratia si reposcatur; Plin. E. i.
ΘΗΛ. It is equivalent to par pari
referre, [Cic. A. xvi, 73] PRA. as ira
est cupiditas doloris ⁷·eponentli3 Sen. de
Li, 3. HEI. [Pers. vi, 66.]

2. Horace amusingly describes the
pertinacity of these declaimers, A. P.
474 ff. PRA-

‘ The Theseid' was an epic poem, of
which Theseus was the hero. ln like
manner we have the Odysseis of Homer,
the AEneis of Virgil, the Achilleis of
Statius, (tre.

Of this Codrus little is known; he
is probably different from the Codrus
mentioned iii, 203. GIF. He is ‘ hoarse'
from constant recitation (FAR. s. vi,
5153 Mart. iv, 8, 23 x, 5, 4 R.) and
pompous declamation. Proeleyat nt tu-
midus rauca tc voce magis-istm Mart.
viii, 3, 153 S. Pers. i, 14. HEI.

3. Impune. [Her. iii, 29, 47.]

According to Lydus (de Mag. i, 403)

the Μῦθος (or Fabula) was divided into
(l) Τραγῳδία, and (II) Κωμῳῖἱαι Τρα-
γῳδίαι wa< subdivided into (i) Κρητι-
Mem ², and (ii) Πραιτεξτιίινωῑ), according
as the stories were Grec-k or Roman:
Κωμῳδῖω into (l) nanceio-ab (Greek as
in Terence after Menander),(ii) 'hym-ab
(Roman, as in Afranius, Scin), (iii)
’Aeremta'vnc (farce, acted by amateurs),
vi, 71 ; (iv) Tassrevoega‘oed (low comedy),
(v) ‘Pmdmmhe (hm-lesque. tragedy), (vi)
Πλαηπεδαρίαῑαῇε actors wore the re-
cinium, see F.) viii, 191 ; and (vii)
Μιμικὺ (low farce, acted by mummers).
(ὃ) From the actors wearing λευκὸς
κρηπῖδας. (b) From the respective dresses,

(ὃ) From Atella, a town of the Osci,
in Campania. F. (d) Because ‘ shop-
keepers, &c.' were the classes repre-
sented. (e) From Rlzintlzo, one of the
authors. (s) From being acted not ou
a raised stage. REU. Praetextoe and
Togatae are sometimes used as the
generic terms for ‘ Tragedy’ and

4. These poems consisted of hexa-
meter and pentameter verses alternately,
which mette is hence called ‘ elegiac.’

5. Telephus, son of Hercules and
Auge, the hero of this tedious tragedy,
was a king of Mysia, who was mortally

afterwards healed by the rust of the
same weapon. Ov. Tr. v, 2, 15. PRA.

Ov. R. A. 47 f. LUB. [“ Weu tem-
per'd weapons, like Pelides' blade‚
Whose humour heal'd the wounds their
sharpness madet‘ G. Cox, Oxford in
1834, pt. i, 1513]

It was usual to leave ‘ a margin,’ and
not to write on the outside or ‘ back’ of
the parchment. LUB. S. Mart. viii, 623
