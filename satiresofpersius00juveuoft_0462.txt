THE SATIRES

SAT. X1V·

Fregit opes; nec parva tamen mensura relictae
Partis erat: totam hanc turbavit filius amens,
95 Dum meliore novas attollit marmore villas.
Quidam sortiti metuentem sabbata patrem,
Nil praeter nubes et coeli numen adorant
Nec distare putant humana carne suillam,
Qua pater abstinuit3 mox et praeputia ponunt:

94. Turbavit: s. vii, 129. R.

96. ‘ Fearful of profaning.’ LUB. s.
vi, 1593 PRA. Pers. r, 180 ff7 note—53
Suet. ii, 763 Petr. xxxv, 63 Just.
xxxvi, 23 R. Ov. R. A. 219; AEl. V.
H. xii, 35; (PZ.) Hor. S. i, 4‚14-2 f;
KG. lOl.

97. Judaei mente sola unumque
numen intelligunt: prqsmzos,qui tlezfm
imagines mortalibus materiis in speeies
hominnm affingant: summum illud
et aeternum neque rtzzztabile ne·
que intersim-unz.- igitar nulla si-
mulacra urbibus suis, nedum templis
sinunt3 Tac. H. v, 5. For a similar
reason Aristophanes caricatured So-
crates as a cloud-worshipper. LUB.
ἵνα δέ τινα ἷσχυρίἱς σέβουσιν οὗΎ ἄγαλμα
οὐδὲν ἔν τοῖς Ἰεροσολύμοις ἐ’σχω· ἅρῥη τοι
δὲ δὴ καὶ ἀειδῆ Θεδν νομίζοντες εἶναι,
περισσᾶτατα ἀνθρώπων dependam· καὶ
αὐτῷ νεών ers μέγιστον καὶ περικαλλέας-α·
τον, πλὴν καθ’ ἴσον ἀχανής τε καὶ &roh-7042&
ἦν, ἐξεποίησαν· Dio xxxvii, 17. Petro-
nius says of the Jew, et eceli szmzmas
advocat au›·2'culas; fr. p. 683. L. Our
author, though sensible enough to laugh
at the deities of pagan Rome, had not
the wisdom to understand the one
true God. He was to Juvenal, as
to the Athenians, ἄγνωστος ἐεὸς Acts
xvii, 23. For ‘⁸ 'lhe world by wisdom
knew not G0d;'’ Ι Cor. i, 21. MAD.
A truth which should sink deep into
our minds. Tacitus, after the sublime
description abore given, carelessly
turned from a Being ⁴ iinmutable, in-
comprehensible, omnipotent, and eter-
nal,‘ as a inere visionary creation of
the Jews, and humbled himself before
the impure and brutal idols of his own
country. Dio, after the lofty and
energetic language he has used, was
unable to perceive the superior under-
standing of the Jews in worshipping a
Being ‘ ineffable and invisible,‘ instead
of the stocks and stenes before which

he himself bowed down. He dismisses
the on e tru e God from his thoughts,
and insults His worshippers as a weak
and credulous nntion! Thus the attri-
butes of Jehovah, though repeated by
the wisest of the heathens after the
Jews, conveyed no ideas to their minds.
]t is to revelation only that we are
indebted for just and rational con-
ceptions on the subject: and if the
deists of modern times have more dis-
tinct and adequate notioris of the Divine
Being, than Tacitus and Dio and Juve-
nal; it is still to the manifestations
which he has been pleased to make of
himself, that they owe them, however
prejudice or pride may operate to pre-
vent the acknowledgement. GIF.

By numen coele· is meant that ‘ the
material heaven’ (“ The blue aetherial
sky 3¹² Addison, Psalm xix3) ‘ is their
deity! MA D. This gross conception of
the Romans arose from the Jews having
no visible representation of the Deity.
Romanorum primus Cn. Pompeius J u-
‹laeos domuit: templnmque jure victoriae
ingressus est. inde vulgatum, nulla in-
tus (lezim effiyie vacuam sedem et inania
arcana3 Tac. H. V, 9. GIF. Unless
we can suppose it to have originated 1

in the narrative of ⁶ the cloud’ which ⁴

appeared on Mount Sinai, and of the
pillar of ‘ cloud‚’ which, as a symbol of
the Divine presence, conducted the
Israelites on their march by day. BRI.
Exodus xiv, &03 xxiv, &03 Psalm
xcvii, 2.

98. Leviticus xi, 73 Tae. H. V, 43 t
PRA. vi, 159. LUB. [An argument
therefore against St Peter's belief in

transubstantiation may be derived from W·

comparing St Mark xiv, 22-243 with
Acts x, 13 f.]

99. ‘ They adopt circumcision,' Sch-
Genesis xvii, 10 ff3 Deuteronomy xi,
16; ut diversitate 7zosec1ntm·; Tac. H.
v, 5; Pers. v, 184. PRA.
