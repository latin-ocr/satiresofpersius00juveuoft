these are not merely poetical exaggera-

sage: “ I supped lately with a person
with whom l am by 110 means intimate,
who,in his own opinion, treated us with
much splendid frugalit53 but according
to mine, in a sordid yet expensive man-
ner. Some very elegant dishes were
served up to himself and a few more of
us3 while those which were placed be-
fore the rest of the company were ex-
tremely cheap and mean. There were
in small bottles, three different sorts of
wine3 not that the guests might take
their choioe, but that they might not
have an option in their power. The
best was for himself and his friends of
the first rank; the next for those of a
lower order3 and the third foz- his own
and his guests' freedmen. One who sat
near me took notice of this circ-um-
stance, and asked me how I approved
of it P Not at all, I replied. Pray
then, said he, what is your method on
such occasions ἕ) WVhen I make an in-
vitation, 1 replied, all are served alike:

not to affront them; and those I think
worthy of a place at my table, I cer-
tainly think worthy oi' every thing it
affords :'' Plin. Ep. ii, 6. GJF.
