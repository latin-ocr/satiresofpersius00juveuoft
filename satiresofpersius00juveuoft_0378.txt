THE SATlRES

SAT. X.

Antoni gladios potuit contemnere, si sic

Omnia dixisset.

Ridenda poemata malo,

125 Quam te conspicuae, divina Philippica, samm,

Volveris a prima quae proxima.

Saevus et illum

Exitus eripuit, quem mirabantur Athenae
Torrentem et pleni moderantem frena theatri.
Dis ille adversis genitus satoque sinistro,

136 Quem pater ardentis massae fuligine lippus
A carbone et forcipibus gladiosque parante
Incude et luteo Vulcano ad rhetora misit.

Juvenal wrote, however, personality
and envy had long been extinct3 and
he evidently diverts himself with the
want of taste, which could permit 5ο
many similar sounds to be crowded into
the compass of a single line. To confess
the truth, there appears, in many parts
of Cicero's works, a predilection for
trifles of this kind, derived, perhaps,
from his long acquaintance with the
rhetoricians and grammarians osGreece.
«ζ Middleton has laboured to establish his
poetical character: Plutarch, he sayS,
reckons Cicero among the most eminent
of the Roman poets3 but Plutarch’s s
judgement‚ 111 this matter, is of no great
weight. Harl he not been the first of
orators, no one would have been unjust
enough to style him the last of poets.

better than his poet-ry, he might have
