THE SATIRES

Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.
Prima scre vota et cunctis notissima templis
Divitiae 3 crescant ut opes, ut maxima toto

25 Nostra sit arca foro.

Sed nulla aconita bibuntur

Fictilibus: tunc illa time, quum pocula sumes
Gemmata et lato Setinum ardebit in auro.
Jamne igitur laudas, quod de sapientibus alter
Ridebat, quoties de limine moverat unum

30 Protuleratque pedem3 flebat contrarius auctor ?

ipsa silentia terren& Virg. AE ii, 755.
Sch. In Nero’s time those who possessed
a few valuables would be anxious to
move them by night, in order to escape
observation. GIF.

plying some degree of power. ACH.

25. The senators and other persons of
property had, for security's sake, strong
hnxes, in the forum of Trajan and that
of Mars, in which they deposited their
money for safety. Hence the place itself
was called Opes. Afterwards, for more
security, they used the temple of Castor
and other temples round the forum. Sch.

The laughing sage was Democritus

of Abdera3 GRA. a man of very
extraordinary talents, and the first
philosopher of his age. He was, how-
ever, the father of all that desolating
philosophy, which, placing the senses
in the roorn oi' reason, tends to ext'm-
guis-h seienoe, while it encourages
personal gratifications. GIF. He is
said to have lived to the age of one
hundred and nine. s. Suid. D. Laert.

30. The crying philosopher was Hera-
clitus of Ephesus. LUB. He was a
stern and rigid moralist of what was
afterwards called the Stoic sch0013 as
little likely to cry upon all occasions,
as the former to laugh. This, however,
was not Juvenal’s concern: their
popular characteristics served his pur-
pose. GIF. He is said to have died
of a dropsy at the age of sixty. Cic. i
