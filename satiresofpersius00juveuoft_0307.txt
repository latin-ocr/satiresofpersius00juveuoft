OF JUVENAL.

Haud tamen invideas vati, quem pulpita pascunt.
Quis tibi Maecenas? quis nunc erit aut Proculeius

95 Aut Fabius? quis Cotta iterum ? quis Lentulus alter?
Tunc par ingenio pretium: tunc utile multis,
Pallere et vinum toto nescire Decembri.

Philomelm vi, 644, note. LUB.
It is said, that in consequence of this
assage, Juvenal was banished from
{comm by whom, is a matter ofdispute.
Some say by Domitian, owing to a
complaint by Paris. But why should
he complain at all? Was he ashamed
of his influence at court? He was more
likely to have gloried in it. Others
say by Hadrian, when Juvenal was an
old man of sourscore, merely because
these lines were supposed to cast some
reflection upon an actor who was a great
favourite with the emperor. If so, this
imperial patron of letters was guilty of
a most arbitrary stretch of authority,
and a most unprovoked piece of cruelty.

{us et modicis instravit pulpita tiq-
m'83 Hor. A. Ρ. 279; PRA. iii, 174;
MAD. s. 87; xiv, 257. R.

94. Maecenas, by his generosity to
virgil and Horace, transmitted his
name to future ages as an appellative
for all munificent patrons of literature.
LUB. PRA. Spenser has an allusion
to these lines: ·‘ But ah! Mecaenas is
yelad in claye, And great Augustus
long ygoe is dead, And all the worthies
liggen wrapt in lead, That matter made
for poets on to playe: For ever, who in
derring-doe were dread, The lostie verse
os hem was loved aye;'' Shep. Cal.

of the Augustan age. Hor. Od. ii, 2, 5;

95. Fabius Maoeimus was a noble
patron, to whom Ovid addressed several
of his epistles from Pontus3 PRA.

Aurelius Cotta, as well as Fabius,
joined to great liberality the rarer
quality of fidelity in distress: GIF.
Or. Pont. ii, 83 iii, 23 53 PRA. te

lere, Pieridum lumen praesidiumque

P. Lentulus Spinther, who was
mainly instrumenta} to the recall os
Cicero, and to whom the orator writes
thus: mayna est hominnm opinio (le te,
maqna commendatio liberalitatis3 Ep.
i, 73 1-9. MAD. R.

It may be wonderful that Juvenal
should never mention Pliny, who was
certainly generous, and in some cases
munificent. He had here an oppor-
tunity of doing so: but perhaps it struck
him that there was more of vanity than
of genuine kindness in the favours Pliny
conferred. In one of his letters he men-
tions his kindness to Martia13 but in a
way that shows he was thinking more
of himself than of the poet. The whole
account is degrading. It was not thus
that Lentulus and Cotta showed their
love of genius. GJF.

96. Fuit moris antiqui eos qui vel
singulorum laudes vel urbium scripse-
rant, aut honoribus aut pecunia ornare .-
nostrz's vero temporibus, ut alia speciosa
et eyrcqia, ita hoc imprimis exolevit.-
nam postquam destitimus laudanda fa-
cere, laudari quoque ineptum putamus3
Plin. Ep. iii, last3 PRA. cura ducum

Paleness was a characteristic ofstudents
as well as of lovers: pallet3 aut amat,

‘ To be a stranger to wine,’ lest it
should impede one's studies: quid,
quod ne mente quidem recte uti pos·
sumus multo cibo et potione completi;
Cic. T. Q. v, 100. Horace, on the con—
trary, who was himself a bon vivant,
prescribes wine for poets, on the au-
thority of C ratinus,and instances Homer
and Ennius as examples of its good

effects: Ep. i, 19, 1 ff. PRA.
