SAT. VI.

Et cellam vacuam atque suam.

OF JUVENAL.

‘219

Tunc nuda papillis

Constitit auratis, titulum mentita Lyciscae,

Ostenditque tuum, generoso Britannice, ventrem.
125 Excepit blanda intrantes atque oera poposcit

Et resupina jacens multorum absorbuit ictus.

Mox, lenone suas jam dimittente puellas,

Tristis abit et, quod potuit, tamen ultima cellam

Clausit, adhuc ardens rigidae tentigine vulvae,
1:30 Et lassata viris nec dum satiata recessit

obscurisque genis turpis fumoque lucernoe

Foeda lupanaris tulit ad pulvinar odorem.

Hippomanes carmenque loquar coctumque venenum
