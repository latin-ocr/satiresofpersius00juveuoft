THE SATIRES

SA'l'. VH.

Esurit, intactam Paridi nisi vendat Agaven.
Ille et militiae multis largitur honorem,
Semestri vatum digitos circumligat auro.

90 Quod non dant proceres, dabit histrio.

Tu Camerinos

Et Bareas, tu nobilium magna atria curas ?
Praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos.

clavii (who were styled ‘illustrious

A. ii, 593 xi, 4.) the purple border
which they wore being either broad
or narrow accordingly. L.SM. This
border seems to have answered the
purpose of gold lace in our days. The
boatswains and boatswains’ mates at
Greenwich Hospital are distinguished
hythe broad or narrow gold lace on

their coats and hats3 if the comparison “

be not derogatory to the semestre-5· mi-
liciole, as the author of Juvenal's life
calls them.

I wish there were any authority for
Supposing ‘the six-months’ or half-
month's gold' to be so called from its
conferring a permanent appointment,
but with only half the annual
sripend: so that the permission to wear
it would give an honorary or brevet
rank, (a re al command, Ι am con—
vinced, it never could,) which gave the
possessor a claim to something like
half-pay, without requiring actual
service3 or, at any rate, to certain
privileges and immunities. Livy v, 4.
This favour (whatever the precise na-
ture of it might be) was bestowed by
generals and prefects. Thus Pliny en-
treats Sossius, one of Trajan’s lieu-
tenants, to confer this honour on the
nephew of his friend C. Nepos: C.
Calvisium Nepotem valde dz'liyos hunc
rogo semestri tribunatu splendidi-
orem et sibi et avunculo strofacz'as3 Ep.
iv, 4; and in another place, he transfers
a tribuneship which he had obtained
sor Suetonius, at the historian’s own re-
quest, to one of his relations: iii, 8.
