xiv PREFACE.

made but little advancement in that knowledge which is so
essential for a Satirist, the knowledge of the world. At the
political and moral degradation os his country he would seem
to have felt no indignatum, at least, he expresses none. He
dreams of no frccdom but that enjoyed by the followers of

Juvenal, like Persius, professes to follow Lucilius'¹; but
what was in one a simple attempt, is in the other a real
imitation of his manner. Less of a courtier than Horace,
and more a man of the world than his immediate precursor,
he laboured with a magnificence of language peculiarly his
own, to pourtray in the strongest colours the loveliness of
virtue and the deformity of vice. What Horace had done
for decorum and taste, that Juvenal did for morals and
liberty. Disdaining artifice of every kind, he boldly raised
his voice against the usurpation of power. With the sword
of satire which he fabricated for himself, he rushes from the
palace to the tavern, from the gates of Rome to the boun-
daries of the empire, and strikes without distinction who-
ever deviates from the course of nature or the paths of
honour⁰.

poet, at times he rises with his theme to the noblest heights
