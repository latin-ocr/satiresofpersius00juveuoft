SATIRE 1.

ARGUMENT.

The Poet commences, as is he intended a tritical moral essay; l: and,
when discouraged by a friend from his design of assuming the censor,
2 ff; he proceeds, in bold defiance of public opinion, to a spirited ex-
posure of the wretched taste of the times; 4 ff.

He repeatedly disclaims all intention of writing for popularity or effect,
4 ff; 26 f ; 44 ff3 and expresses supreme contempt of that mania for
public recitation, which had already excited the ridicule of Horace, and
which, not long after this, provoked the spleen of Juvenal; 14 f. Au
amusing picture is drawn of one of those hoary versifiers, who pander
to the passions of their auditory by grossly luscious strains3 13 ff.
Aster which we are introduced to a younger set, whose sickly appetite
cloys itself with the mawkish swcets of softly sentimental lays; 30 ff.

The cause of this depravation of taste is ingeniously traced to the pedantic
nature of the schools, 69..82; fostered by the interested and ignorant
admiration of sycophants and dependents; 48. .56; 63. .68; men, who
are the very first to ridicule their dupe behind his back3 56. .62.

The Satirist then makes a digression to the bar, of which the language was
grossly vitiated by a meretricious glare of elocution, aud an affected
display of rhetorical subtleties; 83. ,91 : returning to the poets, he
parodies and ridicules the favourites of fashion; 92. ,106; this excites the
alarm of his friend, and draws forth some cautious advice, 107. .llO;
which, as generally happens, only serves to render the writer more
daring, and to give a spirited conclusion to the Satire3 111. .134.

To the contemporaries of Persius, this must have been a very amusing
performance3 but to us, who are ignorant of the true nature of his
parodies, and who cannot, in a single instance, appropriate them with
certainty, it has lost much of its pleasantry. Enough, however, remains

to give a most favourable impression of the youthful critic's humour aud
good sense. GIF. K G.
