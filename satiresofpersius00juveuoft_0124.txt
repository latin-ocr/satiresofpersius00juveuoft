THE SATIRES

SAT. 1.

90 Ad casum tabulae, posita sed luditur arca.
Proelia quanta illic dispensatore videbis
Armigero! Simplexne furor, sestertia centum
Perdere et horrenti tunicam non reddere servo ἓ
Quis totidem erexit villas? quis fercula septem

95 Secreto coenavit avus? Nunc sportula primo
Limine parva sedet, turbae rapienda togatae.
Ille tamen faciem prius inspicit et trepidat, ne
Suppositus venias ac falso nomine poscas.

If a numeral agrees with sestertii, it
denotes so many sestertii, as decem ses-
tertii. (2) If the genitive plural of
sestertii is joined with a numeral in
another case, it denotes so many th ou-
san d, as decem sertertMm=1Q000
sestertii. (3) If joined with a numeral
adverb, it denotes so many hundred
thousand, as (lec-ies sestertium:
1,000‚000 sestertii. (4) The numeral
adverb by itself has the same meaning,
as clecies=1,000‚000 sestertii=1,000

always the contracted genitive, with

habebant, quas populi «mulis sulficere

erubescerent ;

Val. Max. ii, 5, 5.
PRA.

Quis avus ‘ who of our ancestors ?’

The old republicans used to admit to
supper the elients, who attended them
from the forum. Under the emperors
this laudable custom was abolished, and
‘ a little basket' of meat given to each
of thern to carry home. Nero ordered
a small sum of money to be distributed
instead of meat, and Domitian brought
back the former practice3 Suet. vi,
163 xii, 43 7. Perhaps it was subse-
quently left optional, for here we find
that money was again distributed. The
sum was a hundred quadrantes, about
20d. sterling. GIF. 1205 iii, 127 ff;
249 ff; Mart. i, 613 iii, 73 14, 33

probably is used contemptuously‚ as
the toya was no longer worn by re·
spectable persons. See note on 3;
ii, 703 iii, 127; vii, 1363 142; viii, 49;
Hor. S.i‚ 2, 63 ; 82; Mart.ii, 57,5;&c.
R. [Clients were always obliged to
wear their gowns, when they attended

97. See note on 62. The mean-
ness of the patron is strongly marked
by his superintending the distribution
‘ in person.'
