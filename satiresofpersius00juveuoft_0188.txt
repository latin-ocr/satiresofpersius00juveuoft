The offender was then bound alive upon
a bier, and carried through the forum
with great silence and horror. When
they reached the place of interment,
the bier was set down, and the poor
wretch unbound3 a ladder was then
brought, by which she descended into
the excavation; when, upon a signal
given, the ladder was suddenly with-
drawn‚ and the mouth of the cavity
completely filled up with stones, earth,

‘ A mullet' is mugilis. Surmullet÷ were
very plentiful and cheap, but seldom
weighed above 21bs. ln proportion as
they exceeded this they grew valuable,
till at last they reached the sum men-
tioned in the text (about 1350), and
even went beyond it. The fish seems
to have grown larger in the decline of
the empire‚ as if to humour the caprice
of this degenerate people. Horace
thought a surmullet of 3lbs. something
quite out of the common way 3 the next
reign furuished one of 4-{lhsl here we
have one of fflbst! and we read else-
where of others larger still; one of

of 45le was one that was presented to
Tiberius. The emperor sent it to mar-

P. Octavius or Apicius would buy it.
They did bid against each other, till it
was knoeked down to the former for
