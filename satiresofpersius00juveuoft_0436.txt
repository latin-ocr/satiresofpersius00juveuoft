Credebant hoc grande nefas et morte piandum,
55 Si juvenis vetulo non adsurrexerat et si
Barbato cuicumque puer, licet ipse videret
Plura domi fraga et majores glandis acervos.
Tam venerabile erat, praecedere quatuor annis,
Primaque par adeo sacrae lanugo senectae !
60 Nunc, si depositum non infitietur amicus,
Si reddat veterem curn tota aerugine follem,

(KZ.) R. All profane and sacred
history supports Juvenal in his assertion
respecting the reverence anciently pald
to old age. It was synonymous with
power: it continued so, while men led
a pastoral life ς nor did they know any
other judge or leader than the aged,
till a thirst for rapine spread amongst
them, and wisdom and justice were
compelled to give way to activity‚
strength, and brutal ferocity. Solo-
mon‚ by a beautiful figure, calls a
virtuous old age “ a crown of glory‚⁷⁷
Proverbs xvi, 31 : and even so early as
the days of Moses, we find this attention
to age the subject of a positive com-
mand: ‘⁶ Thou shalt rise up before the
hoary head, and honour the face of the
old man ;’' Leviticus xix, 32 t αἰδεῖο-θαι
πολιοκροτάφους εἴκειν δὲ wigonem ἕδρης καὶ
γεράων πάντων γενὲῃδ’ ἀτάλαντον πρέσβυν
ὂμήλικα πατρὶς ἴσαις τιμαῖσι γέραιρε·
Phoeyl. fr. And even among our au-
thor’s countrymen‚ long after the golden
period of which he speaks, age was no
less venerated than venerable: magna
fuit quondam capitis reverentia cani,

erat. verba quis auderet eoram sene
de'yna rubore dicere? censuram longa

our poets, it would be difficult to find a
more beautiful passage on the subject
than this, which is evidently taken from
the text: ‘⁶ ConAx. lt is an impious
age. There was a time, (And pity ’tis

so good a time had wings To fiy away‚)
when reverence was paid To the gray
head: ’twas held a sacrilege Not ex-
