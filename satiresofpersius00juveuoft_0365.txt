SATIRE X.

ARGUMENT.

Τ11ε subject of this inimitable Satire is the Vanityof Human wishes. Such
is the absurdity of mankind in this respect, that we can wonder neither
at the laughter of Democritus, nor at the tears of Heraclitus. 28. .55.

The Poct takes his stand on the great theatre of the world, and summons
before him the illustrious characters of all ages: Cassius Longinus and
Seneca, 163 Sejanus, 633 the first Triumvirate, 10& Demosthenes and
Cicero, 114; Hannibal, 147; Alexander, 1683 Xerxes, 179; Nestor,
2463 Peleus, 256; Laertes, 2573 Priam, 25& Hecuba, 271; Mithridates,
2733 Croesus, 274; Marius, 276; Pompey‚ 2833 Lucretia, 293; Vir-
ginia‚ 294; Hippolytus and Bellerophon, 325; and C. Silius, 330.

As they appear in successim, he shows, from the principal events of their
lives how little happiness is promoted hythe attainment of what our
indistinct and bounded views represent as the most perfect of earthly
blessings. 1. .11.

Of these he instances Wmhh, 12. .27; Power, 56. .113; Eloquence,
114. .132; Military Glory, 133. ‚187; Longevity, 188. .288; and Per-
sonal Accomplishments; 289..345; all of which have, as he observes,
proved dangerous or destructive to their respective possessors.

Hence, he argues the wisdom of acquiescing in the dispensations of Heaven;
and concludes with a form of prayer, in which he points out, with great
force and beauty, the objects for which a rational being may presume to
approach the Almighty. 346. .366.

Juvenal probably had the second Alcibiades of Plato, and the second Satire
of Persius, in his thoughts3 he has taken nothing from them, however,
but the general idea; the filling up is entirely hjs own, and it is done
with a boldness of imagery, and with an awful and impressive sublimity
of style and manner, of which it would perhaps be difficult to find another
example in any composition merely human. G'IF. R. DR Y.

The same subject has been handled by Lucian, (Icarom. p. 205; and N avig.
s. Vota p. 491, t. ii, ed. GV.) Aristotle and other Greeks, (mg) ιῦχῆς·)
Xenophon, (Mem. i, 3, l;) V. Maximus, vii, 2, ext. 13 R. Epictetus,
(Em-hir.) HNN. and by Dr Johnson in his celebrated imitation, The
Vanity of Human wishes. MAD.
