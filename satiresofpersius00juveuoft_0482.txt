SATIRE XV.

*ί*-

ARGUMENT.

In this Satire, which was written after the author's return from Egypt, he
directs his ridicule at the sottish and ferocious bigotry of the natives.

The enumeration of their animal and vegetable gods is a fine specimen of
dignified humour-3 l..l3; and though he may be thought to treat the
actors in the horrid transaction, which makes the chief subject of his
poem, with too indiscriminate a severity, yet it should be considered
that he had. for many justifiable causes, long regarded the country and
the countrymen of Crispinus with aversion: which was not much
diminished, we may presume, by a nearer view of both. GJF.

then he asserts, in general terms, the cannibalism of these ferocious
enthusiastS, 133 he is fully aware of the scepticism of those who hear
such stories for the first time ; 13. ,26 ; but he gives an example which
had actually occurred recently, in the religious feuds of the Tentyrites
and Coptites. 27. .97. Not but what instances were on record of men
eating one another when driven to desperationi and pressed by extreme
famine; 93..114; and barbarians had been known to sacrifice their
sellow-creatures, hut not to devour them. 115. .128. R.

The conclusion of the Satire, which is a just and beautiful description of
the origin of civil society, 147..158; (infinitely superior to any thing
Lucretius or Horace has delivered on the subject,) does honour to the
genius, good sense, and enlightened morality, (I had almost said, piety‚)
of the author. It is not founded in natural instinct, but on principles
of mutual benevolence, 13] ff; implanted, not by Nature, 132:
(as Gibbon carelessly or perversely makes the author assem) but by

Nature's God, 147 ff: in the breast of man, and of man alone.
142 ff. GJF.
