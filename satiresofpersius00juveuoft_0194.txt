Obstitit intranti miratrix turba parumper.

Ut cessit, sacili patuerunt cardine valvae.
Exclusi spectant admissa opsonia Patres.

61. Alba Longa, the faroni-ite re-
sidence of Domitian, stood on the de-
clivity of a hill near a lake which was
famous in Roman story. It was built
by Ascanius, (xii, 70 ff3 Virg. AE. iii,
390 ff3 viii, 43 ff3) and there the
Trojans deposited the sacred fire brought
from Ilium. When the city was de-
stroyed, and Rome became the capital
of the nation, a remnant of the Vestal
fire was still left there, from some su-
perstitious motive, and piously preserved
through all the vicissitudes of the com-
monwealth. Liv. i, 3; 253 :29 ff. Here
Domitian usually kept the Quinqua-
tria in honour of Minerva his tutelary
deity; and here he often convened the
senate. GIRPRA. MAD. 1453 Plin.

⁷ ⁴ The fisher of Picenum,' Sch. might
have found a precedent for his conduct
in Herodotus, (iii, 423) who gives an
account of a very fine fish which was
taken and brought to Polycrates the
tyrant of Samos. The presentation
speech is preserved by the historiam
it is very civil, as might be expected,
but far short of this before us. He-
rodotus adds that Polycrates invited
the fisherman to sup with him: a trait
of politeness which, we may be pretty
confident, Domitian did not think it
necessary to imitate. GIF.
