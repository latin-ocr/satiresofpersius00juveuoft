The words sudes ‘stakes' (iv, 128 3)
and rudes ‘wooden soils' are sometimes
confounded. Probably rudibus is the
correct reading here. Sch. L. vibrare

The Floralia were first sanctiones] by

the government, in the consulship of
Claudius Centho and Sempronius Tudi-
tanus, (513 Y.R.) out of the fines¹ then
exacte-1 for trespasses on the grounds
belonging to the people: (this is Ovid’s
story ;) even then, they were only oc-
casiona13 but about eighteen years after-
wards, on account of the unfavourable
spring, the senate decreed that they
should be celebrated annually, as the

most effectual method to propitiante the
goddess of the season. They probably
had their rise in a very remote age,
and, like the Lupercalia, were the un·
eouth expressions of gratitude of a rude
and baiharous racc, handed down by
tradition, adoptrd by a peoplc as yet
but little rciined, and finally, degene-
rating into licentiousness amidst the
general corruption of manners. These
games were celebrated on the last day
of April, and the first and second day
of May; and with an indecency hardly
credible amongst civilized people. The
lowest women appeared upon the stage,
aud exhibited a variety of obscene
(lances, seats of agility, διο. These
miserable wretches asscmbled at the
sonnd of a trumpet; and the leadcr of
this immodest band must have certainly
required all the impudence, and all the
profligacy, which Juvenal sees in his
female fencer. The people claimed a
privilege of calling upon them, to strip
themselves; which was regularly done
with immense applause! Val. Maxi-
mus says, that when Cato once hap-
pened to be present at these games, the
spectators were ashamed to call upon
the ladies as usual. Cato, who seems
to have expected it, asked his friend
Favorinus,why they delayed; and was
answered, out of respect to him 3 upon
which he immediately left the theatre,
to the greatjoy of the people, who pro-
ceeded toindemnify themselves for their
reluctant forbearance. Martial has an
epigram on this anecdote, in which he
puts a very pertinent question: “ Why,‘'
says he to Cato, “ since you knew the
nature of these games, did you go into
the theatre? was it merely that you
might come out again i’” By the way,
among many other puzzling circum-
stanees in the Roman history, how are
we to account for the high character
which Cato obtained from his country-
men. A parent without affection, a
husband without attachment, a master
without humanity, and a republican
without political honesty, he has yet
come down to us, as one of the most
virtuous men of his age! In his actions,
there would seem little more than prooss
