SATIRE 11.

—-

ARGUMENT.

lt was the Roman custom to offer vows, and send presents to relations and
friends on their birthdays; and Persius, who probably knew that his
beloved Macrinus delighted in verse, embraces the opportunity of this
festival, to send him an excellent moral and religious poem. GIF.

After the exordium, or congratulatory address to Macrinus, l ff ; there is
first an enumeration of interested and impious prayers3 prayers, which,
too iniquitous for the ear of man, can only be trusted to the gods in
private3 3. .16. The gross folly of these prayers is attributable to the
false and unworthy ideas entertained respecting the gods3 17. .30;
52..70. Then follows a spirited exposui-e of those extravagant and
ridiculous petitions for superfluous objects, which originate in ignorance
and superstition; 31..4⁴›. We have next an indignant reproof of the
rash expectations of those, who frame requests for bless'mgs which they
madly labour to defeat by their own vicious excesses3 41. .5l. GIF. KG.

ΤΙιε Satire concludes with some just and elevated remarks on the true
nature of sacrifice and prayer, 71..75; which might be written up in
more than one Christian temple. DMD.

In this little poem, which assumes a tone almost too serious and solemn
for satire, the author had in view the second Alcibiades of Plato, upon
which the tenth Satire of Juvenal is also founded. DR Y. The matter
of this celebrated dialogue‚ (of which Addison has given a pretty analysis
in No. 207 of the Spectator‚) Persius has compressed and arranged with
great care. GJF.
