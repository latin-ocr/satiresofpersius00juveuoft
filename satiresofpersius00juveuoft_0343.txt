worthy prince, it should be observed
that he merely perfected the system
which was struck out by his predeces-

honour of the invention: Suet. i, 39.
Though Augustus extended the shame-
ful practice ; Suet. ii, 43; he subsequent-
ly put a temporary stop to it. After his
death it was revived, and continued
through the succeeding teignis, till it
reached its highest point under Nero.

‹lalous adventure osGracchus, on which
he had before hriefly touched: ii, 143
ff. Every sentens-e, every word that
drops from Juvenal, proves him to he a
sturdy republican, a genuine and unso-
phisticated patriot,who loved the honour
and dignity of his country above his
life3 and felt with the deepest anguish
every act which tended to debase her
in the eye of snrrounding nations. One
of the most striking passages in any
historian extant shows that this debase-
ment was more effectually brought
about by the gladiatorial pursuits of
the young nobility, than by any other
enormity whatever. Dio observes, that,
amidst all the scandalous festivities,
and excesses of Nero, nothing appeared
so truly flagitious and abominable, as
the prostitution of the male and female
nobility, who exhibited themselves in
the orchestra, circus, and amphitheatre,
on a footing with the vilest of the rabblc.
The old and honourable families of the
state, the Furii, the Fabii, the Porcii,
and the Valerii, to whose aneestors
temple-s and trophies had been ereeted
by the public, voluntarily (at least sor
the greatest part) submitted to this de-
gradation, in the presence of all Rome,
and of an immense concourse of people
from every part of the empire! These,
probably, enjoyed, with the highest re-
lish, a spectacle that amply revenged
the conquest of their respective countries
by the ancestors of those who now de-
graded themselves for their amusement.
“ As the sports and combats proceeded,
the strangers pointed out to each other,
the descendants of those great men:
