THE SATIRES

SAT. XIII

Atque nefas, tandem incipiunt sentire peractis

Criminibus.

Tamen ad mores natura recurrit
240 Damnatos‚ fixa et mutari nescia.

Nam quis

Peccandi finem posuit sibi? quando recepit
Ejectum semel adtrita de fronte ruborem ?
Quisnam hominum cst, quem tu contentum videris uno
Flagitio ? Dabit in laqueum vestigia noster
‘245 Perfidus et nigri patietur carceris uncum
Aut maris AEgaei rupem scopulosque frequentes

Exsulibus magnis.

the fall of our first parents: Genesis

'239. Custom becomes second nature.
Seh. s. vii, 50 ff. R. ex voluntate pei·-
versafacta est libido ‚· et ilum servitur
libidini, facta est consuetzulo5 et (lum
consuetudini non resistitur, saeta est
necessitas; August. Conf. viii, 53 [s.

his vomit3 so a fool returneth to his
folly;’' Proverbs xxvi, 11; “ It is

the Ethiopian change his skin‚ or the

240. [“ The only distinct meaning

fixed, or settled? Bp Butler An.

241. Nullum enim vitium desinit
ubi incipim Seu. ΕΑ Y. No wicked
man could ever say to his evil propensity,
“ Hitherto shalt thou come, but no
further ; and here shall thy proud waves
be stayed ;⁷' Job xxxviii, 11 ; s. ii, 83,
note. MAD. The Christian can hardly
wish for a more decisive inference in
favour of the Gospel than is afforded
by this passage. Heathenism could
offer no sufficient indueement to re-
pentane-<³3 and therefore the mind.

once engaged in sin, was for ever en-
slaved to it ; and in the just representa·
tion of the Apostle, “ gave itself over
to work all uncleanness with greedi-
ness;'’ Ephesians iv, 19. From what
a dreadful scene of determined vice
and impenitence has the Christian
world been rescued by the acceptanee
of the doctrine ofremission of sin through
the agency of a mediator! Those who
would admit the morality of the Gospel
without its doctrina! points, should
think again of this. It is observable
that Juvenal, who had been certainly
benefited by the precepts of Christianity,
was uninfiuenced by its saith ε but this
was for a time the case of heathenism
at large. The world was silently im-
proved by the spreading influence of
the Gospel ; till at length the conviction
of its divinity became too strong to be
suppressed3 and what began in the
humbler admiration of moral purity,
ended in the dignity of faith. GIF.
