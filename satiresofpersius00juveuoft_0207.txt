S1 te propositi nondum pudet atquo eadem es! mens,
Ut bona summa putes, aliena vivere quadra;
Si potes illa pati, quae nec Sarmentus iniquas
Caesaris ad mensas nec vilis Galba tulisset:
5 Quamvis jurato metuam tibi credere testi.

Ventre nihil novi frugalius.

Hoc tamen ipsum

Desecisse puta, quod inani sufficit alvo:
Nulla crepido vacat? nusquam pons et tegetis pars

’In the Jpersou of Trebius the poet
attacks parasites generally. ‘ If you
cau put up with the indignities which
the pam ered great think fit to bestow
on their umble companions, you must
be so lost to all sense of honour and
gentlemanly feeling that I should hesi-
tate to believe you on your oath.’ R.
