ὅ THE SATIRES

sA'l‘. Ι.

O cums horminum ! o quantum est in rebus inane !
⁴‘ Quis leget haec ?'' Min tu istud ais? Nemo Hercule.

“ Nemo ?”
Vel duo, vel nemo.

‘⁶ Turpe et miserabiles

Quare ?

Ne mihi Polydamas et Troiades Labeonem

5 Praetulerint? Nugae! Non, si quid turbida Roma
Elevet‚ accedas examenque improbum in illa
Castiges trutina, uec te quaesiveris extra.

2. This verse is from Lucilius. Seh.
The words of some critical friend, who,
aware that Persius has serious intentions
of publishing a satire, throws cold water
upon his design. KG.

Among the Romans it was usual for
men to sweai· by Hercules and women
, by Castor; Gell. xs,⁷⁷6; s. Juv. ii, 98.

3. ‘ But two or three, if any! ‘ It
will be a disgrace, and a thousand
pities !' CS.

‘ Why so? 1 do not write ad cap-
tandnm vulqus? KG. ‘ therefore your
pity is quite thrown away!

4. ‘ Shall I fear' KG. ‘ sinking below
Labeo in the estimation of the prince and
the people: as Hector feared lest Poly-
damas and the Trojans should think dis-
paragingly of him P’ Πουλυδάμας μοι

ας καὶ Τρωάδας {neemia-noos Hom.
11. X 100, 105. This appears to have
become in a manner proverbia13 s,
Cic. to Att. ii, 5; vii, 1. PRA. Poly-
damas was the son of Antenor. Under
this name Nero is perhaps designated:
LUB. as he affected to be greatly in-
terested in all that concerned Troy.
PRA. By the words ‘ Trojan d ames’
, the satirist lasheS, at once, the vanity
of his countrymen in tracing their
origin to the TrojanS, and their de-
generate effeminacy. FAR. CS. J uv.
i, 100. KG.

Accius Labeo was a poet who wasted
his time in translating the Iliad and
Odyssey into Latin, word for word. The
following may serve as a sample of his
version: crudum manduces Priamum
Priamique pisinwos. Sch. s. 50. KG.

5. Turbida ‘ too busy to attend to
such matters :’ Virg- AE.ix, 57; Lueian

Nigr. KG. ‘ The muddy citizens,’
MAD. an equivoque.

Lana> ‘ the scale,⁷ libra ‘ the beam,'
eoeccmen ‘ the tong ue,‘' trutina ⁶ 'the cavity
in which it plays.’ HOL. This is one of
thosetechnicalillustrations, inwhiehthe
Stoics so much delightetl: and means
either (1) to correct the errors of an⁴
apothecary's or goldsmith's balance bya ³
common pair of scales, such as are used
in weighinghulky commodities. Cicero,
in speaking ofsubjeets suited to popular
and philosophical discussion, uses a
similar metaphor: lzcee nostra oratio
multitudini est accommodanda, ad oblec-
{andos animos, ad impellendos, ad ea
probanda,quoe nonaureficisstatera, χ
sed quadam postulari tr ιι tin α ewa· J
m in ιι η t u )·.· Or. ii. GIF. or, (2) Sup-
posiug a balance to be perfect in all other¹
respectS, its tougue, if it be not at right
angles to the bearn, will not tally (when
the scales are in equilibrium) with the
cheeks of the oblong aperture through
which it oscillates. In such a case, re-
store the tongue to its perpendicular, and
all will be right. But when (in addition
to this fault in the tongue) the balance
itself is inaccurate, it is ofno use what-
ever to set the ton gue straight, the scales -
will still be false. Eoeamen is used for
the tongue of the apothecary's balance j
(or statera) in v, 100 f. s· note.

7. ‘ J udge for yourself:’ PRA. γνὸθι
σεαυτόν· atque aliis de te, quam tu tibi,
eredere noli ; Hor. L UB. Those who are
ambitione of praise or popularity are
but too apt to regulate their actions by
the caprice& of those whom they study
to please, rather than by the criterion
of right and wrong. OS. s. Juv. xi,
27, note; AEsoh. P. V. 317. (BUR.)
