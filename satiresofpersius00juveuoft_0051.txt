Nequidquam fundo suspiret numus in imo.
Si tibi crateras argenti incusaque pingui
Auro dona feram, sudes et pectore laevo
Excutiat guttas laetari praetrepidum cor.

lates that in the portico of the Palatine s

AEgyptus); and some of these statues
were said to give oracles by means of

take the liberty of placing the gentle· ·
men in the portico, and silently dis-
missing their sair cousins.

One of our old poets tells us that
mons ‘ a mountain' cometh from mo-
vendo, because it stand eth still:
and a similar train of reasoning seems
to have influenced those, who first gave
the faculty of inspiring dreams to the
fifty sons of AEgyptus. These poor
youths were the last persons in the
world who should have been selected
foi· such a province: they were mar-
ried to their fifty cousins, and, with-
out foreseeing or even dreaming of
their fate, bad their throats eut like so
many calves, (velut vituli) in the same
night, with the exception of one, who
was roused out of a sound sleep by his
wife: “ suryel'' quae dia-ic juveni ma-
rito, “ surge! ne longus tibi somnus,
unde non times, cletum„ Hor. Od. iii,

KG proposes following Acron, for
want of another guide, but, on turning
to the authors of the Augustan age,
finds the ladies only mentioned. We
will give the passages: aurea Phoebi
