Quanta autem inde feres tam dirae praemia culpae,
120 Quum tenues nuper Marius discinxerit Afros?
Curandum in primis, ne magna injuria fiat
Fortibus et miseris. Tollas licet omne, quod usquam est

Et jacula et galeam : spoliatis arma supersunt.
125 Quod modo proposui, non est sententia: verum

Si tibi sancta cohors comitum, si nemo tribunal
Vendit acersecomes, si nullum in conjuge crimen
Nec per conventus et cuncta per oppida curvis

banda to their governments, had long

complaint. Before the time ofAugustus,

that uxorious emperor took Livia with
him in most of his expeditioris, and his
example seems to have had a pernicious
effect; for in the succeoding reign, the

the senate, ne quem magistratum, cui
provincia obvenisset, μαι-ον emue'toretur.
Tacitus observes, that the senate did

to the argumentum ad hominem .· “ Se

ita conducat, alias ad grentes illerum,
hami semper oequo animo, εἰ ab uaeore
carissima deveneram-3⁷ An. iii, 34.
As the proconsuls could not be pre-
vented from taking their wives with
them, it seemed but just that they
should be answerable for their pecu-
latious, &03 and this principle was
recognised by the senate: proficisci
