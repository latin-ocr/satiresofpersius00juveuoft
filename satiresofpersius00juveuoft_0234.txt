THE SATIRES

SAT. VI.

Tuccia vcsicae uon imperat: Appula gannit,

:md recommended both him and his
friend to Augustus. This new spectacle
was a play persoimed by action alone;
it was exhibited on a magnificent
theatre raisc d sor the purpose, and being
accompanied by a better orchestra than
Rome had yet seen, it astonished and
delightcd the people so much, that they
sorsook in some measure their tragic
aud coruic poets‚sor the more expressive
ballets of Pylades and Bathyllus.

To say the truth, these were very ex-
traordinary 111911. The art which they
introdu‹ed they carried to the highest
pitch of perfec-tion, and however skilsul
their followers may hare been, they do
not appear to have added any thing to
the magnificence ot the scene, 01· the
scientifie niovcuients os the first per-
formers. We can form no adequate
idea os tlte attachment os the Romans
to these exhibitious: it degenerated
into a kind of passion, and occupied
their whole souls. Augustus regarded
it with complaceney, and either from a
real 1019 for the art, or from policy,
‹onst-rred honours and immunities on
its 111-01955015. By an old law, inagis-
trates were allowed to inflict corporal
punishment 011 mimi and players 3 pan-
tomimi (such was the expressive name
given to these new performers) were
exempted from this law 3 they were be-
sides allowed to aspire to honours from
which the former were excinded. Such
111-01901100 produced its natural effects3
insolence in the dancers, and parties
among the people. Pylades excelled
111 tragic and Bathyllus in comio sub·
jects3 hence arose disputes 011 their
respectiyemerits, which were conducted
with 311 the warnith of a politica] ques-
tion. Augustus fiattered himself that
he should re—establish tranquillity by
banishing the former3 but he was mis-
taken3 the. people found they had lost
one great source of amusement by his
absence, and their 0131110015 occasioned
his immediate recall. The death of
Bathyllus 50011 aster this event, left
Pylades 1111110111 a rival. He did not
bear 1115 saculties 019911)ν ; 119 frequently
incuited the spectators for not compre-
hending him, and they endeavoured in
their turn to make him feel the weight
os their resenrment. He had a favourite
pupil named Hylas3 this youth 1119)·

opposed to the veteran, who easily tri-
uinphed 0191· his adversary, though he
could not humble him. We hear no
more of Pylades; but Hylas fell under
the displeasure of the emperor soon after,
and, if Ι rightly understand Suetonius,
was, “ contrary to the statute in that
case made and provided,'' publicly
whipped at the door of his own house.

lt appears from this that Augustus
kept the superintendence of these people
in his own hands. Tiberius left them
to themselves, and the consequence of
his indifferenee waS, that the theatres
were frequent-ly made a scene of eon-
tention and blood, in which numbers
of all ranks perished. A variety of re-
gulations, as we leam from Tacitus,
were now made to check the evil, which
they only served to exasperate3 and in
conclusion the emperor was obliged to
shut up the theatres and hanish the per-
foi-mers. In this state were things at
the accession of Caligula. His first care
was to undo every thing that had been
done. Under this profligate madman,
the ballets took 3 licentious turn, and
has-tened the growing degeneracy of
manners. Claudius left. them as he
found 111901 ; but under Nero, the bloody
disputes to which they constantly gave
birth, reluctantly compelled that prince
to banish them once more. He was
too fond of the fine arts, however, to
suffer so capital a branch of them to
langnish in neglect, and therefore
speedily brought back the exiles. From
this time ‘the pantomimi seem to have
fiourished unmolested, until Paris, the
Bathyllus of Domitian's reign, raised
the jealousy of that wretched tyrant,
who put him, and a young daucer who
resembled him, to death, and drove the
rest from Rome. They were recalled the
instant the emperor was assassinated,
and continued through the whole of
Nerva’s and some part of his successor's
reign3 but they were now become so
vitiated by the shameful indulgence of
Caligula, and Nero, that, if we may be
liex‘e Pliny, Trajan finally suppressed
them, at the unanimous desire of the
people.

T 119 chironomon here mentioned, was
a ballet of action founded on the well-
known amour of Leda, in which some
t'arourite dancer (probably Paris) was
