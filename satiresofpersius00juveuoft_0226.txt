SATIRE VI.

ARGUMENT.

This Satire is the most complete of our Author's works; and one in which
all his excellencies are combined. Forcible in argument, flowing in
diction, bold, impassioned‚ and sublime3 it looks as if the Poet, conscious
of the difficulties which he had to grapple with, had taxed all his powers
to do justice to the theme.

lt is addressed to Urs idius Postumus, 35 3 dissuas sive from marriage,
grounded on the impossibility of meeting with any eligible partner; the
good old times being long gone by, when females were chaste and frugaI:
1. .29. If therefore he was tired of a-bachelor's life, he had better bid
adieu to this world altogether. 30. .47.

The catalogue, which it contains, of vices and follies is most appalling·‚
but is 1101 very methodically arranged. Luxury is the source of all,

The ashes of the ladies, whose disreputable actions are here recorded, have
long been covered by the Latian and Flaminian ways; nor have their
follies, or their vices, much similarity with those of modern times.

It would seem from internal evidence, that 11115 Satire was written under
Domitian. It has few political allusions, and from its subject might not
have been displeasing to that ferocious hypocrite, who affected at various
times awonderful anxiety to restrain the licentionsness of the age! GIF.

Among other writers who have been severe upon the female sex are Euri-
pides generally, and Aristophanes in his Thesmophoriazusoe. With
this Satire may also be compared Lucian, Amores c. 33 ff3 c. 38 ff; R.
