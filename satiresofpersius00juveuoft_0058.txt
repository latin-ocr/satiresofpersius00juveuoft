THE SATIRES

SAT· 111.

“ An tali studeam calamo ?'' Cui verba? quid istas
‘20 Succinis ambages? tibi luditur: effluis amens.
Contemnere : sonat vitium percussa, maligne
Respondet viridi non cocta fidelia limo.
Udum et molle lutum es, nunc, nunc properandus et acri

Fingcndus sine fine rota.

Sed rure paterno

⁶25 Est tibi far modicum, purum et sine labe salinum,

Mammoe ‘ of your grandmother,
mamma, or nurse) T. Their father
they called Tala: Catm PRA. [m α m-
mas alque tatas habet Asmm sed
ipsa tatarum dici el mammarum
maazima mamma potest, Mart. i, 101 .]

19. Culpanlmff'rustra calami; Hor.
S. ii 3 7. T.

Cili derha, understand (las, T. ‘whom
do you deceive by such frivolous ex-
cuses? not me !' PRA.

20. Tibe· luditur ⁶ the stake is your
own.⁷ (The verb is used impersonally as
vivitur-5 V, 533 eonem-ritu›·; Hor. S. i,
l, 7. MAD.) This reminds one of the
sapient speech [of Ensign Northing-
ton]: “ My father and mother wished to
make me elever: books I hated. They
wanted to send me to school: school
I detested. However, they did send
me.—But I nicked the old puts3
for I never learnt any thing !’'

Effine's is a metaphor srom a leaky
jar.’CS. Some difficulty in following
the poet arises from his putting the
illustration before the example. These
familiar metaphors of the Stoics con·
tribute to their being intelligible, though
they may not always be very creditable
to their taste. GIF.

21. C'ontemuere3 Hor. S. ii, 3,14.
Sch.

‘ A cracked jar betrays its flaw by
the dead sound which it yields when
struck) LUB. ἀλλὰ μὴ καθάπερ αἱ
πονηραὶ χύΤξαΙ δΙακρόυόμὲῩαΙ, μὴ σαθρὸν
ἀτοφθίνγγκται· Luc. Paras. t. ii, p. 841 ;
KG. v, 243 106.

Nec voa· hominem sonat; Virg.

IlIaligne respondet is opposed to soli-
dum crepa& v, 25. PRA.

23. Idoneus arti cuilibet: argilla
quidvis imitaberis 7( ‹la; Hor. Ep. ii, 2,
7 s; MAI). verens in vitiemzflecti; A.
P. 1633 s. V, 40; KG. dum tener est
nulus, 1ψηινιύδοε insere mores. SVL.

Properamlus: S. Juv. iv, 134 3 Virg.
G. i, 2603 Or. M. v, 3963 xv, 748. KG.

Acri ⁴ rapid :⁷ Virg. G. iii, 141.

24. Sine fine: we never reach per-
fection‚ therefore there is always room
for improvement. SVL. If we stop
short, there is every danger of our going
backwards. Plin. Ep. vii, 9, ll. KG.

Sed ¹350· This has been the language
of vicious indolence from the first mo-
ment that wealth became heritable:
“ What needs me care for anie bookish ’-
skill, To blot white paper with my rest-
less quill ; Or waste o’er painted leaves,
on winter nights, Ill-smelling oyles, or
some still-watching lights Ρ Let them
that meane to earne their bread—sor

Α .ῐκ,,λ-

me, Busie their braines with deeper
beokerie: Have Ι not landes of faire
inheritance Derived by right of long
continuance To first-borne males,'’ &c.
Han, S. ii, 2. GIF.

25. ‘A competency.’ MAD. Not
such a superabundance as to provoke 1
Nemesis. s. Luc. v, 527 f. KG. [Y, ⁸

‘ The salt-cellar' or, as our old writers
more simply termed it, ‘the salt,' formed
a distinguished feature in the garniture
of the Roman tables. As salt was the
general seasoning of the food of man
and was also used to check the progress
of putrefaction, it was associated, from
the earliest ages, with notions of moral
purity, and occasionally employed in
metaphors too sacred to be repeated
here. Salt made a part of every sacri-
fice3 and hence the vessel which held
it acquired a certain degree of sanctity
and was supposed to consecrate the
table on which, at meal times, it was
reverently placed,bef0re the other arti-
cles: (sacras facitis mensas salinorum
appositu; Arn. WB.) if the salt was
ever forgotten, it was looked upon as
a bad omen. With these claims to
peculiar veneration, the salt-cellar ap-
pears to have been regarded as a kind
of heir-loom, and to have descended
from sire to son. Hor. Od. ii, 16, 13 f.
