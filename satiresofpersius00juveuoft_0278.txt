SAT. VI.

Adventum, nisi se centum lustraverit ovis
Et xerampelinas veteres donaverit ipsi,

520 Ut, quidquid subiti ct magui discriminis instat,

Νεκυομ. 9. 'lhe Archigallus, consulted
by the superstitious woman, now delivers
an orac-le, hig with menaced evils from
the gods to guilty sinners, and urges
her to propitiate the wrath of heaven
by offerings and penances and expiatory
rites. In like manner the priestess of
Bellona utters her predictions in Tib. i,
6, 51 ff3 see also the eracles delivered
in Arist. Eq. 1010 ff. (sunm sistrum

‘ He predicte that danger is to be
apprehended from the sultry and damp
blasts ofautumn.'BRO.iv‚56 ff. MA D.
It needed no very sapient conjuror to
anticipnte such perils3 but he exag-
gerated them, no doubt, with all his art.
518. ‘ Eggs’ were commonly used in
expiatione, especially in those connected
with the worship of Isis; ΒΗΘ. 5.ν,85;
Ov. A. A. ii, 330;' Hor. Ep. V, 19 ff3
Pers, V, 185. (KG.) R. τὰ ἐκ τῶν καθαρ·
σιῶν ὦδε were on no account to be eaten,
but to be thrown away out of doors.

this was done, and were indehted for
many a good omelet to this superstitious
notiori. ACH.
