THE SATIRES

SAT. IV.

Quales tunc epulas ipsum glutisse putemus
Endopcratorem, quum, tot sestertia, partem

Jaln princeps equitum, magna qui voce solebat
Vendere municipes fricta de merce siluros?

29. Emloperator x, 1383 the obsoleto
poetic-al torm of imperator (which is
inadmissible in epic verse) used by En-
nius and Lucretius: with ἔνδον, the
Greek for in, prefixed. R. Imperator
(l) in its simplest sense denotes ‘the
general of an army,⁷ administrator rei
yerendae3 Cic. de Or. i, 48, 210. (2)
More emphatically it is ‘a commander in
chief, who, upon a signal and important
service, had this title conferred upon
him by the. acclamation of the soldiers
or a decree of the senate) This, both
during the republic, (castella muni-
tissima, nocturno Pomptinii adventu,
nostro matutino, cepimus, incendimus:
Imperatores appellati snnms3 Cic.
Att. v, 203) and after. (Tiberius id
tuoque Blaeso tritum zlt imperator α
eyz'onibus salutm-etur, prisco crya (laces
honore, qni bene θῆκε-ἵει republica et im-
petn victoris exereitus conclamabantur3
Tac An. iii, 743 Cic. Phil. xiv, 4 s;
Plin. Pan. 12; 515.) Thus from the
name of an office, it became a title of
dignity, which was not regularly ap-
plied unless a certain number of the
enemy were slain: (D. Cass. xxxvii,
40.) Appian says ]0‚000. (B. C. ii,
p⁴ m. 455.) And it was conferred but
once in one war: Claudius, in tis war
against Britain, “was repeate‹l3y sa-
luted imperator, though contrary to
established rules.⁷’ (D. Cass. lx, 21.)
This title was commonly expressed
on their coins both under the re-
publio and after. (SN, diss. X, t. ii,
p. 180 ff.) (3) Under J. Caesar the
word took a third signification, and im-
plied the chief civil authority, or whsst

we understand by ‘ e m p e ro r.’

Cass. xliii, 44.) Imperator in this ,
sense is prefixed to a name; in the two
other senses it is put after it: as Im-

perator Ocesar Angustum Liv. i, 193

and on the other hand M. Tullius Im-

perator, as in the address of man'y of

his letters. Recepit Julius praeno-
men Imperatoris, cognomen Patris
Patriae3 Suet. i, 76. The second sense
was not destroyed by the third; for
many emperors were saluted as im-
pe ratores long after their accession.
Octavian, for instance, had that com-
p'liment paid him upwards of twenty
times. (Tac. A. i, 93) TY, Civil Law,
