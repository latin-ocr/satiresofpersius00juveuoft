Anxietate carens animus facit, omnis acerbi
Impatiens, cupidus silvarum aptusque bibendis

Fontibus Aonidum.

Neque enim cantare sub antro

60 Pierio thyrsumve potest contingere sana
Paupertas atque aeris inops, quo nocte dieque
Corpus eget: satur est, quum dicit Horatius EVOE !
Quis locus ingenio, nisi quum se carmine solo
Vexant et dominis Cirrhae Nysaeque feruntur

65 Pectora nostra, duas non admittentia curas?

taken into the favour of Maecenas;

quently to this period. His odes were
mostly composed later than his Satires.

thoughtS, when he wrote the following
noble lines: ‘⁴ The vaunted verse a. va-
cant head demaundes; Ne wont with
erabbed care the Muses dwell3 Un-
wisely wmves, that takes two webbes
in hand. Who ever casts to compasse
wightie prise, And thinkes to throwe
out thundring words of threat, Let
powre in lavish cupS, and thriftie bittes
of meate, For Bacchus fruite is friend
to Phoebus wise3 And, when with wine
the braine begins to sweat, The numbers
flowe as fast as spring doth rise. Thou
kenst not, Percie, how the rime should
rage3 O if my temples were distain'd
with wine, And girtin girlonds of wilde
yvie twine, How I could reare the Muse
on stately stage, And teach her tread
aloft inbuskin fine, With quaint Bellona
in her equipage !⁷' Shep. Cal. AEgl. x,
