PROLOGUE TO THE SA'l'lRES.

ARGUMENT.

In this little poem, though irrelevant to the main objects of the work to
which it serves as an introduction, there is much pleasantry and spirit.
Persius however had little notion of what we call keeping‘: and the
village bard, 63 diffident of his own talents, ancl driven by necessity
alone to the exercise of them, 8 ff ; is no sooner fairly embarked, than
he launches out into a critical examination of the literary pretensious of
his contemporaries, S. i; and assumes a decisive tone upon all the subtle
disquisitions of the schools; S. iii, and v. GJF.

The practice of prefixing to a poem, or collection of poem& shorter pieces
in a different metre became more common afterwards, with Claudian in
particular. K G. ln our own times we have very felicitous instances of
it in Sir lValter Scott's Lay of the Last Minstrel.
