viii PRE FACE-

In extracting srom the mass of Annotations whatever ap-
peared necessary or usesul, the Editor kept before his eyes
Hearne's motto “SUUM emQUE :'’ and when, as would often
be the case, his own opinions or illustrations were antici-
pated‚ he chose to relinquish them in silence rather than
risk the imputation of plagiarism. Hence the earlier com-
mentators will fill a more conspicuous place here than in the
generality of modern editions: since, from Calderinus and
Britannicus downwards‚ the annotators have been free in
borrowing from their predecessors and sparing in acknow-
ledgementS. All observations to the prejudice of his sellow·
labourers in the same field, it has been his wish to avoid:
for the aid of each among thern, however slight, he has felt
gratefu13 and their occasional errors, from which none can
be exempt, have (as far as tested with himself) been willingly
consigned to oblivion. The initials denote t'ne authorities
from whom the substance of the notes is taken, (though in
the Variorum edition the actual annotator could not always
be ascertained z) for such alone as are unappropriated, is the
present Editor responsible. In verifying the references of his
predecessors, or in supplying them when altogether omitted,
much pains have been bestowed.

The following brief memoir of our two Satirists is taken
principally from Gifford. According to other authorities,
Juvenal wrote many of his Satires after the age of eightyj,
at which advanced time of life he was banished, and that by
Trajan, whom he had complimented in the opening of the
very Satire which fonned the alleged grievance. The short
time which the Editor had for the eompletion of the work,

few days before his death3 and WValler appears not, in my opinion, to have lost,
at eighty-two, an)⁷ part of his poetieal power.’' Young, too, published his “ Re-
signation'' on the other side of fourseore: yet there is no “proof of deeaying

saculties. There is Young iu every stanza, such as he often was in his highest
vigour.’' Johnson's Lires of the Poets.
