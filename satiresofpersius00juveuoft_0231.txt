Sed placet Ursidio lex Julia: tollen¹ dulcem
Cogitat heredem cariturus turture magno

40 Mullorumque jubis et captatore macello.
Quid fieri non posse putes, si jungitur ulla
Ursidio? si moechorum notissimus olim
Stulta maritali jain porrigit ora capistro,
Quem toties texit perituri cista Latini?

38. Ursidius, having sown his wild
oats, has now no objection to the rigid
enforcement of the Julian law against
adultery, aud is willinp: to trust to thar
security for the fidelity of his future
spouse; at the same time he is ‹lesirous
of qnalifying himself for becoming an
heir or legatee, by renouncing celibacy,
which (according to another Julian
law) incapacitated a person from re-
ceiving either an inheritanee or a be-
quest by legaey, unless of kin to the
testator. Sch. L, on Tac. An. iii, 25.
See ii, 37; ix, 87 ff; R. PRA. Plin.
vi, 313 Mart. vi, 7. GIF.

It is a common notion that a new-
born infant was laid on the ground, and
that the father by taking it up acknow-
leda-ed it for his own: whence arose
the phrase tollere [Cic. At. ii, 9 ;] or
suscipere [a poet in Cic. D.i, 213]
liberos. But the latter verb is applied
to the mother also: Plaut. Truc. ii, 4,
45; Ter. Heaut. iii, 5, 14 f; R. [Livy
iv 54.
