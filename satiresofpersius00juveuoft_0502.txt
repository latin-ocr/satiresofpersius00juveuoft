38. In the infancy of agriculture,
when artificial bound-aries, heslges,
walls, &03 were unknown, large
stoneS, set up at certain distanceS‚
separated the lands of one proprietor
from those of another. As these were
easily displaced, it became necessary
to secure them hy extraordinary pre-
caution. Dreadful threats were ac-
cordingl3 denounced against such as
removed them, in the old world, and
“ Cursed be he¹ that removeth his neigh-
bour’s landmark’' (Deuteronomy xxvii,
17 ;)was probahl3 found in the religi =ous
code of ever) nation. W hen men fell to
idolatry, such comminations lost their
terror, and legislators and priests were

driven to other expedients.
(Terminus) was created;
mere—stones were converted into altars
to his name, and invested with a sacred
character: it was consequently an act
of sacrilege to stir them snm their
places3 and thus the divisinns of land
were in a great measure maintained.
Of the innumerable superstitious of
ethnicism, this was at once the most
elegant and the most useful; it was
also one of the most innocent: sor the
offerings, which were usually made by
the rustics in procession, consisted of
the produce of the soil, flowers, fruits,
unguents, and, the invariable concomi-

tants of every7 sacrifice, wine and the
salted cake. The fullest account of it

annual xisit·· tion, which was perpe-

tuated, with the p'roperty it protected,
from father to son, seems to have en-
deared the rite to the ancients; who
speak of it with a degree of tenderness
and affection,which they do not always
express for those of a more public and
important nature: nam veneror, seu
stipes habet desertus in ayris, seu vetus
in trivioflorea serta lapis: ᾂες Tib. i,
l, ll ff. (ΗΥ.) The institution is attri-
buted to Numa‚b3⁷ Plutarch: the more
probable fact is, that this prince brought
to the rude and barbarous hordes‚whom‚
happily for themselves, he was called
to govern‚ the rites and ceremonies of
a more refined and virtuous people.
His denunciations against those who
removed ‘ the sacred landmark' are even
