THE SATlRES

SAT- 111.

Eripient somnum Druso vitulisque marinis.

Si vocat officium, turba cedente vehetur

240 Dives et ingenti curret super ora Liburno
Atque obiter leget aut scribet vel dormiet intus;
Namque facit somnum clausa lectica fenestra.
Ante tamen veniet ε nobis properantibus obstat
Unda prior: magno populus premit agmine lumbos,

Ferit hic cubito, ferit assere duro

Alter 3 at hic tignum capiti incutit, ille metretam.
Pinguia crura luto3 planta mox undique magna
Calcor et in digito clavus mihi militis haeret.

The humour in coupling Drusus with
these sleopy creatures and placing the
latter within ear-sliat of the muleteers
and eoaohmen in the heart of the city,
is quite overlooked by the majority of
