ARGUMENT.

Under a pretence of pointing out to his friend Gallus the advantages osa
military state, 1..6; the author attacks, with considerable spirit, the
exclusive privileges which the army had acquired or usurped, to the.
manifest injury of the civil part of the c‹›1nmu11ity; 7 ff. GJF. The
military had now got to such a pitch of licentioris-ness, as to insult' their
fellow-citizens with gross impunity; 9. ,l2. Every complaint against a
soldier must be brought before a court—martia13 where the plaintiff
obtained little redress‚ while he incurred the most imminent peril.
13. ‚34. Again, whereas all other citizens suffer deplorably by the delays
of the law, to soldiers there is always a court open ; and their causes are
immediately heard, and as promptly decided3 35. ‚50.

Soldiers have also the peculiar privilege of disposing of the property they
acquire in the service, even in their father’s lifetirne: 51. .56; and this
property is not inconsiderable, as it is the policy of a general to heap
riches and honours upon his meritorious follower53 56. .60. R.

The outline presented scope for a picture not unworthy of the peneil of
Juvenal; and indeed, what is touched of it, possesses at times a con-
siderable degree of merit. Mueh, however, yet remained to be filled up,
(s. Polyb. vi, 39; L, Mil. Rom. v, 193 de Magn. Rom. i, 6;) when the
writer, as if alarmed at the boldness of his own design, hurried on the
conclusion, with an abruptness which mars the whole. effect. GIF.
lndeed whether or no Juvenal was the writer has been much disputed.
[It is exploded by most, and said not to be Juvenal's. Scir] On the
affirmative side of the question are Priscian, Servius,[ CAL ]SCA.DP.

At any rate it seems an unfinished piece ; MAD. and Ι have marked it
accordingly.
