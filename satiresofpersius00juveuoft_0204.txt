THE SATIRES OF JUVENAL.

SAT. lv.

Tamquam de Cattis aliquid torvisque Sygambris
Dicturus, tamquam diversis partibus orbis
Anxia praecipiti venisset epistola pinna.

150

Atque utinam his potius nugis tota illa dedisset

Tempora saevitiae, claras quibus abstulit Urbi
Illustresque animas impune et vindice nullo!
Sed periit, postquam cerdonibus esse timendus
Coeperat: hoc nocuit Lamiarum caedc madenti.

147. The Cattz' occupied the ‘terri-
tories ofHesse,[and Thuringia, stretch-
ing from the Saale to the Eder: A W.]
the Syyambri those of Guelders. s. Suet.
xii, 23 63 133 PRA. and Euseb.
Dio liv, 2ος 22; 32; Flor. iv, 12; Oros.
vi, 21. The latter are termedferflces;
Hor. Od. iv, 2, 34; ccede gaudentem
ib. 14, 51. Tacitus says of the
Germans, habitu-s· corporum idem om-
nibus: truces et coerulei oculi ; 4 ; Cal-
tornm lzoec prima semper acies, visu
torva3 31. R.

148. ‘ In order to communicate.⁷
149. Ifa consul transmitted to Rome
the news of a victory, a small branc-h
of bay was stuck in the letter3 (Plin.

H. N. xxxv, 58 ; Pan. 8 3) if he sent
intelligence of any reverses, he inserted
‘ afeather.’ Sch. (The latter part is
questionable.) Couriers wore feathers
in their caps ; when they brought good
news they wore a white feather, (libelli
quos ‘rumor alba vellit penna3 Mart. x,
.3, 10 ς) and a black one when the news
was bad, (nullaque jimzosa signatur
lancea penna; Stat. S. v, 1, 93; where
ficmosa ‘dingy' is a correction of sa-
mosa.) PLA. Or, simply, ‘ with pre-
cipitate haste.' R. [Livy v, 28, 10;
Eur. O. 861-866.]
151. Suet. xii, 10;11; 15. PRA.
152. Ἰφθίμονς ’ψ ux ά ς· Hom. Il. A
153. Cerdo (from κέρδος ‘ lucre’) ‘a
eobbler‚ or any low mechanic.' The
assassins of Domitian were men of low
birth3 Suet. xii, 143 17. LUB. ‘A
Plebeian,⁵ Pers. iv, 51 ; PRA. as op-
posed to Pati-icians3 viii, 182; s. iii,
294. R. “ Of her noblest citizens de-
prived, Rome daily mourned-and yet
the wretch survive-d, And no avenger
rose; but when the low And base-born
rabble came to sear the blow, And
6011111615ΐι·61111116<1-ῒ11611,ῒο rise-

no more, He fell still reeking with the
Lami an gore.” BDH. Beaumont
and Fletcher have imitated or rather
translated these lines: ‘⁴ Princes may
pick their suffering nobles out, And
one by one, employ them to the blnek;
But when they once grow formidable to
Their elowns, and cobblers, ware then !''
GIF. [“ Itis remarkable that Rube-
spierre himself was safe, till he attacked
his own ate-complices· The spirit of
men of virtue was broken3 and there
was no vigour of character left to destroy
111111, but in those daring ruffians who
were the sharers of his tyranny ;’'
Mackintosh, Def. of Peltier, 1803.]

154. ‘This was fatal? LUB.

The Lamian family was a noble
branch of the AElian clau: from which
the imperial family of the Antonines
also sprung. They traced their deseent
from Lamus king of the Laestrygones.
Hor. Od. iii, 17, l ff. One of this an-
cient house was among Domitian's many
victims3 LUB. the tyrant, before he
came to the throne, had taken away
his wife Domitia Longina: MAD.
Suet. xii, l 3 and put him to death, sub-
sequently, ob suspiciosos quidem, verum
et veteres et innoxios j⁰0⁰⁸3 ib. 103
PRA. s. vi, 385.

'I his is a severe reflection on the pusil-
lanimity of the Patricians who tamely
submittes] to such cruelties and indig-
nities. PRA. The exultation‚ with
which the poet mentions the prompt
and decisix‘e vengeance of the lower
orclem, shows that he felt proud in being
one of them⁷ and seems intended to
convey a salutary‚ but awful 1esson,
both to the oppressors and to the op-
pressed. GIF. This satire proves that
Juvenal survived Domitian; who was
assassinated in the sorty-fifth year of
his age and the sixteenth of his
reign, and was succeeded by Nerva,
96 A.D. MAD.
