Simplicitas, cujus non audeo dicere nomen?

Quid refert dictis ignoscat Mucius, an non ?

Qua stantes ardent, qui fixo gutture sumant,

155. ⁶ Dare to put down the name
of Tiyellinus, and you will be treated
as an incendiary.’ O. Offimius Tigel-
linus of Agrigentum uras recommended
to the notice of Nero by his debauche-
ries. After the murder of Burrhus, he
suceeeded to the command of the prae-
torian guards, and abused his ascend-
ancy over the emperor to the most
dreadful purposes. He afterwards be-
trayed him; by which, and other acts
of perfidy, he secured himself during
Galba's short reign. He was put to
death by Otho, to the great'joy of the
people, and died, as he had lived, a
profligate and a coward. See 59. Who
is here designated by the name of
Tigellinus, cannot now be known ; even
in Trajan’s reign there were depraved
favourites, whose enmity it would be
perilous to provoke. sch. GIF. Mart.

’Tieclwl juniani. The dreadful fire,
which laid waste a great part of Rome
in the reign os Nem, was found to have
broken out in the house of Tigellinus
His notorious intimacy with the emperor

corroborated the general suspicion that.
the conflagration was owing to design.
Nero was exasperated at the discovery,
and, to avert the odium from his fa-
vourite, basely taxed the Christiane
with setting fire to the house. Thou-
sands of those innocent victims were
sacrificed in consequence: multitudo
ingens convicti sunt.- εἰ pereuntibus
