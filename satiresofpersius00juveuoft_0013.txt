PREFACE. xi

composed a few lines, ou the influence of Paris, with con-
siderable success, which encouraged him to cultivate this
kind of poetry: he had, however, the prudcnce not to
commit himself to an auditory, in a reign which swarmed
with informers, and only circulated his compositions pri-
vately among his friends. By degrees he grew bolder3
and, having made many large additions to his first sketch,
if not recast it, produced what is now called Satire vii ¹,
which he recited to a numerous assemblage, about 83 A. D.
The consequences were such as hc might have anticipated.
Paris is said to have been informed of his own introduction
into the piece, and to have taken such umbrage, as to lay
a formal complaint of it before the emperor ¹¹¹. If, owing to
this representation, Juvenal was banished from Rome, under
the pretence of an appointment to a military command in
Upper Egypt, his exile would be of no long duration3 as
the favourite was, almost immediately aster, disgraced and
put to death. That our author was in Egypt is certain¹¹3 but
he might have gone thither from motives of persona] safety:
for in 94 A.D. Domitian banished the philosophers from
Rome, and soon after from Italy, with many circumstances
of cruelty. Now, though Juvenal, strictly speaking, did not
come under the description of a philosopher, yet, like the
hare in the fable, he might not unreasonably entertain some
apprehensions for his safety, and, with many other persons
eminent for learning and virtue, might deem it prudent to
withdraw from the city. We may therefore refer hisjourney
into Egypt to this period: but it does not appear that he
was ever long absent from Rome, where there is strong
internal evidence to show that all his Satires were written.
Whether his Egyptian voyage was matter of necessity or
prudence, we find henceforth in our author the most intense
