“ Quo didicisse, nisi hoc termentum et qum semel intus
25 Innata est, rupto jecore exierit caprificus ?'’

En pallor seniumque ! o mores ἔ

Usque adeone

Scire tuum nihil est, nisi tc scire hoc sciat alter?
“ At pulchrum cst digito monstrari, ct dicier, mc κεί· !
Ten cirratorum centum dictata fuisse

30 Pro nihilo pendas ?''

Ecce inter pocula quaerunt

Romulidae saturi, quid dia poemata narrent.
Hic aliquis, cui circum humeros hyacinthina laena cst,
Rancidulum quiddam balba de nare locutus,

dixerit, ur9ue; et crescentem tumidis
insta sermonibus utrem; Hor. S. ii, 5,
96 ff3 PRA. ohe!jam satis est; id. S.

as they are, tingle with shame.’ GIF.
or ‘ Bloated, like one swollen with the
dropsy! Lucilius caus ⁶ vanity,' aquam

⁷24. The apologist first tries the meta-
phor of ‘ leaven,’ (Juv. iii, 188 ;) but,
finding this an awkward one, as it might
be readily compared to the vanity which
was working and swelling within him,he
abruptly leaves it for the still more un-
lucky one of ‘ the wild fig-tree ;' (Juv.
x, 145, note 3) for after this had burst to
light, the question of quo (Juv. viii, 9,
note3) didicisse ‘ What are the fruits :'”
would still recur. LUB. OS. PRA.

25. By jumbling these incongruous
metaphora, the Satirist may also intend
to parody and ridicule the style of these
eoneeited poetasters. LUB.

26 - ⁴ Worthy fruits indeed of such in-
tense studies,(Juv.vii‚ 97, note3 MAD.)
and such advanced years! OS. s. Hor.
Ep. i, 18, 473 Ep. ii, 2, 82 ff; KG.
1243 iii, 85; v, 62.

Ο tempora! o mores! Cic. Cat. i, 1.
MAD.

27. This is taken from Lucilius: Sch.
id me nolo scire mihi cujus sam consciu’
solus ; ne damnum faciam scire est 718-

28. Μὲπεινον ι’ἰὶρὶιο praetereuntium

Romanaefidicen lyrae3 Hor. od. iv, 3,

22 f. Cicero finds fault with Demos-
thenes sor being pleased at hearing a poor
woman whisper to her neighbour, αὖφις ⁵
ἰκιῖνοςέ Τ. Q. V, 36; Sch. Luc. Som. t. ⁸
i, c. 2; s. Ov. Am. iii, 1, 17 ff. KG.
Pliny thinks there was no great barm
in this3 Ep. ix, 23, 5. GES. Certainly
the censure comes with an ill grace
from Cicero. s. δατ. i, 161. [digitus is
derived from δυκιῦω, s. VP, E. D. 124,
1; STE, Τὴῑ. G. 3151, c and α]

29. ‘ To be introduced as a class book
into first-rate schools ; where you are
read by the youth of quality,’ “ Brave
lads with curled locks of gold.'’ HOL. s.
Juv. vii, 226 ; Mart. i, 35 ; cirrata
caterva magi-dr& ix, 30, 7. KG.

30. This custom is evident fromAthe- 2
naeus. Juv. vi, 434 ff. It might serve ψ
well for entertainment’s sake, but was of
little use as far as intellectual improve-
ment was concemed: discite, uon inter
lances mensasque nitentes, cum stupet
insanis acies fulgoribus, et cum acclinis
salsis animus meliora recusam verum
hic impransi mecum disquirite: Hor.
S. ii, 2, 4 ff; PRA. Plin. Ep. i, 15, 2;
ix, 36, 4. KG.

31. Quid dia (Sulpicia 48) poemata
narrent? (Plaut. Pers. iv, 3, 29 3)
may be considered as the question of
one of these noblemen, therefore Persius
is not chargeable with the inaccuracy in
the use of this verb. KG.

Romulidae sarcastically, as Quirites,
Juv. iii, 603 especially as Romulus was
very abstemious3 Geli. xi, 14. PRA.

32. Tyrioque ardebat murice leena
demissa ex humeris ,· Virg. AE. iv, 262 f ;
CS. s.Juv.vii, 1363 iii‚2s·3‚ notes. KG.

33. ‘ Snuffling through his nose some
stale ditty! GIF.
