more severe than those os the Hebrew
legislator: Qui terminum esarasi't, ipsus
ee boveis sacred sunto. The Fathers
are much offended at this superstition,
which continued to a late period, and
was not given up without a struggle,
as tho husbandman persisted in con·
necting the idea of a prosperous year
with the due observance of his rural
ceremonies. Their fulminations at
length prevailed3 and Prudentius, who
witnessed the desecration of these land-
marks, observes with some degree of
triumph over the superstitious fears of
the mstis-1, that sunshine and rain still
visited the earth, which had yet lost
nothing ofitn pristine fertility! et Iapis

Sym. 1005. But in his time, and, in-
deed, long before, the simplicity of the
ancient worship had been corrupted:
spargitur et eaesa communis Terminus
aqna5 ner: queritur, lactens cam sibi
porca datum· Ov. F. ii, 640-684. (HS.
BU.) The blood of lambs and kids
was mingled with the primitive fruits
and flowers3 and, as property was se-
cured by other means, its abolition was
no less desirable than expedient3 GIF.

42. ‘ I shall have to wait for months
and months, before the multitudinous
suits of the people come on, and mine
among the rest.¹ dum comuntur, dnm
ornantur, annus est: Ter. Heaut. ii,

2, 11; s. Suet. x, 103 Plin. Ep. i,

45. Sternuntur may here signisy the
spreading of the judges’ benclies with
cushions, ὠο. MAD. No business is
done, because there is not a quorum.
‘Although the eloquent Caedicius has
already laid aside his surtout and ap-
pears in his gown to plead; (Mart. viii,
283 Plin. Ep. ii, 33 iv, 23) and Fuscus
has now taken the opportunity of step-
ping aside for a few minutes, because
he will soon be called upon to speak
and will not then be able to leave the
court;' HEI. s. ix, 28 f; Quint. xi,3.
lacernas f·›r hle-ernam is no uncommon
enallage. R.

46. C'cedicius is apparently a different
person from the one mentioned in xiii,

Fuscus (not the general, iv, 112 ;) but
Aurelius Fuscus, a distinguished advo-
cate of those dayS‚ who was both fond
of the bottle himself and was kept in
countenance by his lady; xii, 453 Plin.
Ep. vii, 93 Mart. vii, ⁶28. LUB. R.

C'. Titius, vir oetalae's aniHmzoe, in
oratione qua legem Fanniam suasit,
describens hanzines prodigos in sorum
adjudicandam ebrios commeantes, sic
ait :- . . . “ ad comitium vadunt ne litem
saciant suam. dam eunt, nulla est in
angiporto amphora, (Luc-r. iv, 10233)
quam non impleantqmyme qui vesicam
plenam vini habeant. veniunt in eomi-
tium tristes: jubent dicem& quornm
neqotium est, narrant: judea· testes
poscit,- ipsus it mictum.- uboe' redit, nil
se audisse omnia : tabulas poscit ; lile-
ras inspicit; via· prce vino sustinet pal-
pebras;'' Macr. iii, 16. LUB. Plt’A.
The same cause would produce the
same effect in the advocate as· in the
judge. R.
