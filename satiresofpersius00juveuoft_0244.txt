THE SATIRES

SAT. Vl.

(Quantulum in hoc !) pueros omnes, ergastula tota3
Quodque domi non cst et habet vicinus, ematur.
Mense quidem brumae, quo jam mercator Iason
Clausus et armatis obstat casa candida nautis,

155 Grandia tolluntur crystallina, maxima rursus
Murrhina, deinde adamas notissimus et Beronices

153. (l) The feast of the Saturnalia
in December w as succeeded by the Sigil-
laria, 3 fancy fair3 where seals, and
other little articles, which the Romans
used toq send each other as presents
(Macr.S .i, 10 end3 Gen. ii, 33 v, 4;
BOE, pp. 217 f; 236 s.) were exposed
for sale‘ in white canvas booths' (casis
candidis) erected both in other parts of
the city and also against the walls in the
portico of Neptune (D. Cass. liii, 27 ;)
so as ‘to hide' the paintings with which
it was adorned, and the subject ofwhich
was the Argonautic expedition. The
handsome wife would not mr ss her op-
portunity of extorting valuable fairings
from her complaisant spouse. Sch. LZ.
(2) Another interpretation is ‘ W hen the
winter detains on shore the merchant
(thus Hyacinthus and Prometheus, in
the note on 110 ;) and his crew,who are
equipped for starting as soon as weather
will allow, but cannot yet commence
their voyage; (Veget. iv, 39; Plin. ii,
47 pr; Hor. Od.i,4, 1 ;) since the 0311111,
white with snow or hoar-frost, shows
that the reign of winter is not past!

155. [“Crystal and myrrhine cups,
emboss'd with gems And studs ofpearl‚”
Milton P. R. iv, 119 f;] ‘are taken
from the merchant’s;’ GRA. or ‘are
wheedled out of the husband. '⁴ LZ.

The word vasa is understood: their
being grandia and maoeima would of
course enhance their price. mm alibi

156. Pliny says that these vases were
first introduced by Pompey after his
victory over Mithridates: eadem victoria
primum in urbem murrlzina induoeiM
primusque Pompeius sea· pocula eoe eo
triumpho Capitolino Jovi dicavit, quae
protenus ad hominum usum transiere3
eoecrescitque indies ejus rei luxu33
xxxvii, 23 7 f. Propertius, who had
undoubtedly seen them, says murrlzea-
qne in Parthis pocula coctafoci33 iv, 5,
263 iii, 10, 22. This seems a verygood
description ofwhat we callp orce 1 a i n:
SC'A. but Pliny, who could not be ig-
norant of it, adds Oriens mut-rhina
mittit.- in veniuntur enim ibi in
pluribus locis, nec insiynibus, mamime
Parthici regni ,· proecipue tamen in
Carmania. It is manifest that Pliny
takes them for gems t and so he else-
where terms them, xxxiii, 2: in which
he is followed by Martial, xiv, 1133 xiii,
107; and others. The districts he men-
tions still afford a gem that answers, in
some measure, to his description: it is
a species of anate. GIF. FAR. Suet.
ii, 71. R. The variety of conflicting
accounts and opinions can hardly be
reconciled without supposing two sorts
of these vases3 one artificial ‘ the por-
celain,' the other a natural production-
Ι have had in my possession a mineral‚
which bears the name of ‘poreelain
jasper‚’ (C'lzinesischer Speclcslein ; Vel-
theim.) but I do not know where it is
chiefly found. [s. ΗΑΒ, Ο. 1, 5.]
