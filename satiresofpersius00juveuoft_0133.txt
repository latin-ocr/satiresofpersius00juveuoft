SATIRE ΙΙ.

ARGUMENT.

This satire, in point of time, was probably the first which Juvenal wrote,
lt contains an irregular but animated attaek upon the hypocrisy of
philosophers and reformers5 whose wickedness it exposes with just se-
verity, 1. .28. Domitian here becomes the hero: and the poet must have
had an intrepid spirit to produce and circulate, though but in private,
such a faithful picture of that ferocious tyrant, at once the censor and
the pattern of profligacy, 29 ff. The corruption, beginning at the
head, is represented as rapidly spreading dowuwards, 34. .81. Even the

victorious progress of the Roman arms served but to diffuse corruption
more widely, 159. .170.

Infidelity was now universal, 149. . 152. Such was the depravity and im-
piety, that a club was formed to dress up as females and burlesque the
rites of the Good Goddess, 82. . 1 14. There were even iustances of
men marrying each other, 115. ‚142; and of Roman nobles degrading
themselves by playing the gladiator, 143. . 148. How would the heroes of

primitive Rome receive in the shades below their degenerate posterity?
153. ‚158. GIF. R.

There is a close correspondence between this Satire and Dio Chrysost.
