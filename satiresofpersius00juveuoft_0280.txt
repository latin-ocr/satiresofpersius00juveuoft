THE SATl RES

sAT. vl.

Ibit ad AEgypti finem calidaque petitas
A Meroe portabit aquas, ut spargat in aedem
Isidis, antiquo quae proxima surgit ovili.

530 Credit enim ipsius dominae se voce moneri.
En animam et mentem, eum qua di nocte loquantur!

‘ Atiam-,³ and it comprises the greatest

as Lampridius says, enrolled himself part of the kingdom of Sennaar and

among the priests of Isis, and conde-
scended to carry her son (the dog-
headed Anubis) upon his shoulders.
Constantine abolished them, with the
other heathen rites: they were again
revived, and for the last time, by that
frivolous pedant Julian, (so liberally
duhbed a philosopher by our Christian
historians‚) who laboured to enforce the
observance of them in some of his epis-
tles. But however severe the satirists
may have been on these follies, they fall
infinitely short of the prophets. See
Isaiah xliv, 14 ff3 xlvi, 6 f. These pas-
sages prove the great antiquity of such

idolatrous and mendicant processions.

In conclusion it may be observed, that
they are sneered at by Menander with
an arch and elegant simplicity, only to
he found in the writers of his school:
