320. Ceres and Diana were especially
worshipped at Aquinum: therefore they
here stand for the town itself. The
origin of the epithet ‘ Helvine’ is un-
certain: (1) from the Helvii, a people

MAD. GIF. Dio says that Caligula
wore the shoe from which he derived
his name, to mark his renunciation of
his former town shoes ; dne> τᾶν οἱστι-
ufir §fatumia-m. Umbricius may here
avow a similar determination. He
promises that he will not appear in shoes
of a town make; that there shall be
nothing about him, even on his feet, to
remind Juvenal of the detested city.
JR. “ In country shoes I’ll come.''
BDH.

There is something exquisitely beauti-
fulin this conclusion. The little eircum-
stances which accelerate the departure
of Umbricius, the tendet farewell he
takes of his friend, the compliment he
introduces to his abilities‚ aud the af-
fectionate hint he throws out, that, in
spite of his attachment to Cumae,
Juvenal may command his assistance
in the noble task in which he is en—
gaged, all contribute to leave a pleasing
impression of melancholy on the mind,
and interest the render deeply in the
fate of this neglected, but virtuous and
amiable exile. GIF.
