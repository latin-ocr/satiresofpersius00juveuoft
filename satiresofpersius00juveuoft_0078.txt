THE SATIRES

SAT. V.

Folle premis ventos3 nec clauso murmure raucus
Nescio quid tecum grave cornicaris inepte 3
Nec stloppo tumidas intendis rumpere buccas.
Verba togae sequeris, junctura callidus acri,

15 Ore teres modico, pallentes radere mores
Doctus et ingenuo culpam defigere ludo.

11. See iii, 81, note. MAI).

12. ‘ Nor do you croak;' Priscian
viii, 828 3 alii intra se nes-vio quid cor-
nit-antes {mnemia verba trutinantur,
&65 S. Hier. Ep. iv; PRA. κρώζειν·
Arist. Pl. 369; (Sch.) Virg. G. i, 389.
(ΗΥ.) KG.

Inepte; Hor. A. P. 457 f. KG.

13. Stloppus is the sound made b)-
inflating the cheeks to their utmost
extent, and then forcibly expelling the
air by striking them together with the
hands. PRA. “

14. Verba loyce. This phrase must
have signified ‘ the language of good
society at Rome,’ as distinguished from
that of the populace, (tunicatus popel-
lzcs‚) and from that of the provinces
and a great part of Italy, where “ none
assumed the toga but the dead.” The
toya had fallen into general disuse
among the lower orders in the days of
Augustus, and from his reign to the
age in which Persius lived, there was
sufficient time sor the invention of a
term so obvious. The phrase in question
was not coined by Persius himself, but
owed its origin to some one of the in—
numerable dicaces et urbani who had
preceded him; he employed it as 3
well known and familiar expression.

Notum si callida verbum reddiderit
junctura novum ; Hor. A. P. 47 f. eal-
lidus, ‘ workmanly,’ is there used (as it
is by Persius) in strict conformity to
the metaphor3 (s. 1, 64, note.) acri-5·
junctura may be understood to signify
what a workman might call ί 3 sharp
joint,' meaning one that was close and
accurate. We may conclude that the
expression used by Persius, like those
of Horace, was familiar and usual in
his time, that it had its origin in the.
manufactory and the shop, and was
from thence transferred into the phrase-
ology of the higher orders as indicative
of elaborate accuracv, either in litera-
ture or upholsteiy. FEE.

15. Ore teres mmlieo is descriptive

of the natural and easy mode of re-
01131100 suited to compositions in a
familiar style, as opposed to the stretch-
mouthed declamation of the heroic
poets. The frequent recurrence of
poetica] rehearsals, and the obligation
of attending them, is mentioned not
only in instances in which it might be
considered as a ludicrous exaggeration,

hut seriously by Pliny, among others, s v, ¹ .

as one of the main inconveniences
attendant upon a residence in Rome.
An occupation which took up so much
of the leisure of a refined and fastidious
people must have given rise to a variety
of phrases such as that of which Persius
here makes use. FEE. s. Hor. A. P.
323; OS. V. Flac. ii, 2423 (BU.) KG.
plena quaedam oratio, et tamen teres ac
lenuis, at non sine nervis ac viribus;
Cic. Or. iii, 1973 PRA. not like the
specimen in i, 98. .102. MAD.
Pallentes may allude to the effects
of a guilty conscience: 11ἰί conscire sibi,
nulla pallescere culpa: Hor. Ep. i, 1,
61 ; LUB. Juv. i, 165 ff. KG. Or the
images and expression may be taken
from the spectacles of the circus. Ra-
dere means to graze with a dart 01·
other missile weapon‚ which accounts
for pallentes; and as the [mli ylacliatorii
and the venationes of the Circus were
considered as degrading to those who
exhibited themselves, the poet, in ap-
plying the metaphor to himself, takes
care to qualify the word ludus bv the

epithet ofz'ngenuus ‘ gentlemanly.’[Hor. τ

Ο. 1, 27, 16.] The games of the Circus,
likewise, must have furnished a large
supply of phrases to the conversational
dialect of a people among whom they
were considered as an object ofinterest‚
second only to the immediate necessaries
of life, panem et circenses. The associa·
tion of ideas between a satirist reciting,
and an armed man in a menacing atti-
tude, is not peculiar to Persius, it occurs
in Juvenal, ense velut stricto quoties
Lucilius ardet3 1, 165. Τ110 apparent
