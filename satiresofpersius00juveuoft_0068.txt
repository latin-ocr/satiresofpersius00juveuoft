THE SATIRES OF PERSIUS.

SAT. ΠΙ.

“ Tange, miser, venas ct pone in pectore dextram:
Nil calet hic! Smnmosque pedes attinge manusque:
Non frigent !’' Visa est si sorte pecunia, sive

110 Candida vicini subrisit molle puella,

Cor tibi rite salit? Positum est algente catino
Durum olus et populi cribro decussa salina:
Tentemus fauces: tenero latet ulcus in ore
Putre, quod haud deceat plebeia radere beta.

115 Alges, quum excussit membris timor albus aristas.
Nunc face supposita fervescit sanguis et ira
scintillant oculi, dicisque facisque, quod ipse
Non sani esse hominis non sanus juret Orestes.

107. The youth, drowsy as he is, is
still awake enough to discover that he is
somehow involved in this apologue. As
the preceptor, however. appears to him
to labour under a considerable mistake,
he prepares to set him right3 and in a
somewhatindignanttone (miser.')affirms
himself to be in no danger of‘ trumpets
and torches,’ as is falsely insinuated, sor
that the state of his health is excellent
It is now that the philosopher sees his
adwmtages, and turns upon the poor
dreamer with the moral of his sable,
which he enforces with all the poignancy
of satire and all the dignity of truth.
The student can no longer mistake, for
he is presented with an epitome of his
most besetting vices, and, among others,
that of ungovernable passion, of which
he had furuished a tolerahle specimen
already: 8 f. GIF. KG.
