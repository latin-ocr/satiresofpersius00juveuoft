sATIRE V.

ARGUMENT.

ln this excellent Sinite, Juvenal takes occasion, under pretence of ndvising
one Trebius to abstain from the table of Virro, a man of rank and
fortune, to give a spirited detail of the mortifications which the poor were
subjected to hythe rich, at those entertainments to which, on account
of the politica! connexion subsisting between patrous and clients, it was
sometimes thought necessary to invite them.

He represents even a beggar's life as one of independence compared with
that of a parasite; l. . 1 l. The supercilious patron thinks an occasional
invitation to be a payment in full of all his client's services, 12. .23; and
yet, when at the great man’s board, poor Trebius meets with nothing
but mortifications and affronts. The host has all the luxuries of the
seusun—a variety of fine old wines‚ 30. .37; ieed water, 49 f; excellent
white bread, 70 ff; a magnificent lohster‚ 80 ff3 surmujlet, 92. .98;
lamprey, 99..102; giblets‚ 1143 poultry, 1153 wild-boar, 116; truffles,
116 ἥς mushrooms, 147 f; &e. διο. and a delicious dessert, 149..152;
not to mention the splendid service of plate, 37. .⁴5; and the ostentatious
retinue of pampered menia1s3 403 56 ff3 67; 72 ff; 83; 120 ff; while
you are put at the bottom of the table among a vulgar and quarrelsome
set of fellows, 25. .29; and—one can hardly call it—served by some
ill-conditioned underlingS‚ 40 f; 52. .55; 66 f; 73. .75; with vile wine
24 ff ; in a cracked mug, 46. .48; bad water, 52 ς infamous bread, 67 ff;
crab and eggs to correspond, 84 f ; stale cabbage and rancid oil, 86. ‚91 ;

ι an ecl—the sight of which is enough! 103; and a well-fed fish-—c-aught
in the common sewer, 104 f ; a dish of toadstools, 146 ; and two or three
half-rotten apples; 153. . 155. Besides all this, you must not open your
lips, either to make any observati0n‚ 125 ff ; or to call for what you want,
60 ff3 or to ask your patron to take wine3 129..l31. Money forms
his criterion of merit, 132. .137; especially where there is any chance
of that money being one day his; l37..145. Towards his poor ac-
quaintance he behaves just as if he derived amusement from tantalizing and
insulting them3 156 ff. They, who have the meanness to submit to such
treatment, deserve still worse3 161 . . 173.

A train of manly indignation pervades the whole; and there is scarcely
a single trait of ’ insult and indignity here mentioned, which is not to be
found animadverted upon, with more or less severity, in the writers cf
that age.
