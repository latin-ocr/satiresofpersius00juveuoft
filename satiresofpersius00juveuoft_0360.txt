THE SATIRES

SAT. IX.

Haec soli commissa tibi celare memento
Et tacitus nostras intra te fige querelas.

Tamquam prodiderim, quidquid scio.

bus. By this law, it was provided
amongst other things; (l) that persons
living in a state of celihacy should not
succeed to an inheritance, except in
cases of very near relationship, unless
they married within a hundred days of
the death of the testator: (2) that, if a
married person had no child⁷ a tenth
part, anr', in some cases, a much greater
proportion of what was bequeathed him,
should fall to the exchequer. Virro
was no longer in this situation; he had
a child, and was, therefore, capable of
the ⁶ whole bequest! (3) That those
who at Rome had three children law-
fully born in wedlock. (in the other parts
of ltaly four, and in the provinces

privileges and immunities, of which the
principal were, an exemption from the
trouble of wardship, a priority in bear-

calls ⁵ wind-falls’ (caduca) were those
unexpected legacies which were left a
person on certain conditions, such as
those ofbeing married, having children,
&03 <which were all settled by the same
law,) and on failure of these conditions
carne to another party named by the
testator, on like terms: in default of
which the whole lapsed to the prince.

The avowed purpose of these and simi—
lar clauses, was to promote population,
at a time when Italy had been thiuned
by a long succession of civil wars3 and
certainly they were well calculated to
answer the end. They were, however,
abused, like every other salutary re-
gulmiom and the most important of
thern, the jus trium liberorum (or ‘ the
privilege annexed to having three chil-
dren') was frequently granted not only
to those who had no children, but even
to those who were never married ! privi-
