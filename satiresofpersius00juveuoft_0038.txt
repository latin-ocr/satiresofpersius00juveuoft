THE SATIREs

SAT. Ι.

Sunt, quos Pacuviusque et verrucosa moretur
Antiopa, aerumnz's cor luctff'cabz'le fulta.
Hos pueris monitus patres infundere lippos

80 Quum videas, quaerisnc, unde haec sartago loquendi
Venerit in linguas? unde istuc dedecus, in quo
Trossulus exsultat tibi per subsellia levis?

ut rorulentos terras ferro fidas pro-
scindant 9lcbas. The obstinate attach-
ment of the Romans to their earliest
poets annoyed Horace and the critics
of the Augustan age. After a lapse of
three-score years, the same fondness
still existed. The very defects of the
old writers were carefully copied. A
corrupt age is always an affected one:
simplicity is lost in silliness; and vigour
in preposterous tumour. Rude and ob-
solete terms were culled from the old
drama to gratify a morbid taste, a sickly
delicacy which had no relish of nature,
and to the indulgence of which the poet
justly attributes the corruption of fo-
rensic eloquence and the debility of
metrical composition. qnid quod nihil
jam proprium placet, dum parum cre-
ditur disertum quod alius daverit? a

mum ingeniosi, si all intellzyemlos nos.

77. Pacuvius was more ancient and
more eminent than Accius, in con-
junction with whom he is frequently
mentioned: attonitusque legis terra‘e'
fr uyise ra '2', Accius et quidquid Pa-
cuviusque vomunt; Mart. xi, 91, 6.

,1 He was a native of Brundusium, and
a paintel· as well as a poet: he died
131 B. C. His mother was a sister of
Ennius. CS. Gell. i, 24; xiii, 23 Quint.
x,1; PRA. V. Pat. ii, 9, 3; Cic. to
Her. ii, 23. Our satirist does not mean

to disparage the gen e ral merits of
these old writers. KG.

‘ VVarty! MAD. “ Hard and horny.'’

‘Fascinates.’ Hor. Ep. i, 13, 17.

78. Quis Ennii Medeam et Pacuvii
A n [iopam contemnat et rejiciat Y?
Cic. Fin. i, 2. Antiopa, when divorced
by Lycus for her intrigue with Jupiter, 3,
was tormented by his new wife Dirce;
on whom she afterwards took drea‘dsul
vengeance. SVL. Apoll. iii, 5, 5. (HY.) i

‘ Her dolorific heart shored round -
with teen.' aerumna was obsolete when
Quintilian wrote3 he gives labor as
tantamount to it. But, though a pro-
fuse and promiscuous introduction of an-
tiquated terms is censurable, a sparing
and judicious use of them has its ad-
vantages3 and, at all events, a lan-
guage is not much the worse for pos· ⁶
sessing two words with nearly the same
meaning. GIF.

80. Sartayo is literally a frying·pan;
and the allusion is to the miscellaneous
ingredients of the hash3 and also, per—
haps, to the hissing and sputtering of l,
the olla podrida while undergoing the f
process of cookery: T. FAR. as in
our BUBBLE AND SQUEAK. (Unless
Bubble be derived from bubale: as
bubale frustum ⁶ a bees-steak from a
wild ox.' Petron.) “ They have made
our English tongue a gallimaufrey κ

Epist. Pref. to Spenser’s Shep. Cal.
‘⁴ Such patching maketh Littleton’s
hotchpot of our tongue, and, in ‚
effect, brings the same rather to a 5-
Babellish confusion than any one entire
language ;” Camden's Remains.
