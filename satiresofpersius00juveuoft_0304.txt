In this and the following lines Juvenal
alludes to various passages in Virgil, (tn
whom he was evidently very partial,)
but chiefly to these two: (1) (livam

AEn. vii, 323-571. PRA. These are
good specimens of the sublime, espe-
cially the first, yet might not our
author have found, in the compass of
Latin poetry, something more to his
purpose? From Ennius, Horat-e has
a quotation of much force and sublimity:
and Lucretius (who had also his
Maecenas) would have furnished ex-
arnples of greater tire and animation.
But Lucretius was doomed to mis-
fortune: his contemporaries neither
saw his beauties nor his defen-'153 and
succeeding writers, if they did not
entirely neglect his poetry‚ plundered
him, and were sile-nt. His philosophy
ruined his poetry in the eyes of Rome.

we can credit Donatus) possessed (prope
centies Hs) about a million and a half
sterling, owing to the munificence of
his friends, and had a town house in
Esquiliae near the gardens of Maeeenas,
though he spent most of his time in
retirement at his Campanian villa(Gell.
vii, 203) and in Sicily. R.
