Quem colis, et Musarum et Apollinis aede relicta.
Ipse facit versus atque uni cedit Homero
Propter mille annos, aut, si dulcedine famae

40 Succensus recites, maculosas commodat aedes.
Haec longe ferrata domus servite jubetur,

Scit dare libertos extrema in parte sedentes
Ordinis et magnas comitum disponere voces.

45 Nemo dabit regum, quanti subsellia constent
Et quae conducto pendent anabathra tigillo

et ambire σοφίαν, ut sint, qui dignentur

struit, et subsellia conducit, et libellos
dispergit ; et ut beatissimus recitationum
esus eventus prosequat ur, omnis illa laus
intra mium aut alterum diem, velut in
herba vel flore proecepta, ad nullam
certam et solidam pervenit sruyem, nec
aut amicitiam inde refert, aut cliente-
lam, aut mansurum in animo eujus-
quam beneficium, sed clamorem vagum
