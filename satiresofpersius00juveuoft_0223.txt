Boletus domin03 sed qualem Claudius edit
Ante illum uxoris, post quem nil amplius edit.
Virro sibi et reliquis Virronibus illa jubebit
150 Poma dari, quorum solo pascaris odore3
Qualia perpetuus Phaeacum auctumnus habebat,
Credere quae possis subrepta sororibus Afris.
Tu scabie frueris mali, quod in aggere rodit,

147. “ The agaricus caesareus or‘

4 imperial agaric’ is the most splendid
of all the species; itis common in Italy
and is brought to the markets there for
sale. The ancient Romans esteemed
it one of the greatest luxuries of the
table. This is the mushroom with
which Claudius was poisoned ;'' Miller’s

153. ‘ Such as a monkey eata! Sch.

After weighing the various opinions
of Commentators upon these three lines,
I think the following paraphrase gives
their sense; ‘You are at liberty to

themselves by giving to a monkey, and
laugh to see the nice discrimination
with which Μι- Pug turns it about to
nibble the sound part ; while he sits in
his regimentals on the back of his
bearded eharger before the gate of their
barraeks, after going through his manual
exercise with due gravity and precision,
and in as much military awe of his
master's whip, as any ofthe raw recruits
who are grinning at him ever felt for
the cane of their driu-sergeant! To
say ‘ the apple which the soldier gives
away’ is more severe than saying‘ that
which he eats.' The monkey nibbling
his apple between whiles is more cha-
racteristic, and the comparison more
degrading. (See the simile in the pas·
sage of Lucian, quoted at 157.) The
lash was not used in the Roman army.
[flagellum however may mean ‘ a vine
switch,' compare viii, 2473 with Vir.
G. ii, 299]
