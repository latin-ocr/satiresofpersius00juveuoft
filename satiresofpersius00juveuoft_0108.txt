The catasta was a kind of moveable
machine, in which the slaves were
ι ranged on different platforms according
to their age or stature. It appears to
have been appropriated to the more
select and valuable ones: inspexit mol-
les pueros, oculisque eomedit non hos
quos primoe prostituere casce, secl quos
arc-auce servant tabulata catastae, et
qnos non populus, nec mea teo-ba videt3

kind of sereen or lattice-work3 especially
as the slaves were stripped for inspee-

me would be found the person who
could also assign a limit to the heap of
Chrysippus; who could also affirm with
precision how many grains of corn just
constitute a heap, so that but one
