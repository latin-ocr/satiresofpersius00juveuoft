SATJRE III.

ARGUMENT.

Umbricius, an eminent soothsayer, (aruspicum in nostro (evo peritissimus;
Plin. who, on the day Galba was murdered, predictcd the impending
treason3 Tac. H. i, 27; Plut.) disgusted at the prevalence of vice and
the total disregard of needy and unassuming virtue, is introduced as on
the point of quitting Rome, l..9. The poet accompanies him a short v
distance out of the town, 10. .2Ο ; when the honest exile, no longer able

to suppress his indignation, stops short, and in a strain of animated
invective, acquaints his friend with the cause of his retirement, 21 ff.

This Satire is managed with wonderful ingenuity. The way by which
Juvenal conducts Umbricius, ll ff 3 is calculated to raise a thousand
teuder images in his mind; and, when he stops to look at it for the last
time, in a spot endeared by religion, covered with the venei-able relies
of antiquity, and in itself eminently beautiful, we are led to listen with a
melancholy interest to the farewell of the solitary fugitive.

The discourse of Umbricius may be resolved under the following heads:
F lattery and Vice are the only thriving arts at Rome, 21. ‚57 ; in these
points the Romans are left far in the distance by the foreigners, more
especially the Greeks, who resort to the city in such shoals; 58. .125.
Poor clients are not only defrauded of their dues by wealthy competitors,
126. ,130 3 but have the mortification of seeing low-born fellows put over
their head, 131..136; 153 ff; and of finding themselves universally
slighted, 137. .163. T hen the expense of living in Rome is enormous,
147 ff3 164 ff; 223. .225. Resides, you are in constant apprehension
of being either buried by some overgrown, top-heavy, building, or burut
in your bed, 190. ,222 ; that is, if you can coutrive to fall asleep in the
midst of such a din and racket; 232..238. Unless you are rich you
cannot move about town with any comfort, 239. .267; and if you stir out
after dark, you are almost sure of a broken head, either from some
missile out of a garret-window, 268. ,277 ; or from the cudgel of some
choice spirit, xx ho has sallied into the streets in quest of an adventure:
278..301: should you try to avoid such a rencounter by striking into
the lanes, you run the risk of being robbed and murdered by one of
those numerous ruffians, who, for the accommodatiori of the honest
citizens, have been hunted into Rome, and there left to exercise their

vocation unshackled, as the blacksmiths cannot keep pace with the
demand for irons, 302. .314.

After alleging these various reasons for leaving town, Umbricius bids an
affectionate farewell to his friend, 315. .322. GIF. R.
