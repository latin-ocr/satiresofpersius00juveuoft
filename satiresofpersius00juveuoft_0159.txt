resulting from the frequent sight of
these maesacres, rendered instances of
compassion but lare. If any where,
we might have anticipated such pity
would be found in the breaks-ts of the

No war or pestilence ever swept away

to his friend s'oynes, shows that he had
this Satire before him : ‘⁶ But how may
I this honour now attaine, That cannot
dye the colour blac-k a lyer? My

fayn, To cloke the truth, for praise
without desert, Of them that list all
vice sor to retayne.'' Hence he. cannot
prefer Chaueer's Tale of Sir Topas to
his Palaemon and Arcite: he cannot
“ Praise Syr Topas for a noble tale,
And scorne the story that the Knight
tolde. Praise him for counsell that is
dronke of ale; Grinne when he laughes
that beareth all the sway, Frowne
when he frowne«, and grone when ho
is pale; On others' lust to hang both
night and day.'’ G-IF.
