SATIRE III.

ARGUMENT,

The whole of this Satire manifests an earnest desire to reclaim the youthful
nobility from their idle and vieious habits. It opens not unhappily.
A professor of the Stoic school abruptly enters the bed-room of his
pupils, whom he finds asleep at mid-day; l. .6. Their confusion at this
detection, 7..9, and their real indolence amidst an affected ardour for
study, 10. .14, are exposed; and the fatal consequences of such thought-
less conduct is beautifully illustrated by apt- allusions to the favourite
topics of the Porch3 15. .24.

The preceptor, after a brief ebullition of contempt, points out the evils to
which the neglect of philosophy (i. e. the study of virtue) will expose
them, and overthrows the objections which they raise against the neces·
sity of severe application, 011 account of their birth and fortune ; 24. .30.
In a sublime and terrible apostrophe, he pourtrays the horrors of that
late remorse which must afflict the vicions, when they contemplate the
fallen state to which the neglect of wisdom has consigned them; 31 . .43.

He then describes, in a lighter tone, the defects of his own education,
44. .51‚ and shows that the persons whom he addresses are without this
apolog-y for their errors, 52. ‚653 he points out, with admirable brevity
and force, the proper pursuits of a well-regulated mind, 66..76‚ and
teaches them to despise the scorn of the vulgar and the rude buffoonery
of wauton ignorance, 77. .87 : lastly, he introduces a lively apologue of
a glutton‚ who, in spite of advice, perseveres in his intemperance till he
becomes its victim, 88. ,106 ; concluding with an apposite application of

the fable (after the fashion of the Stoics) to a diseased mind ; 107. .118.

The Satire and its moral may be fitly summed up in the solemn injunc-
tion of a wiser man than the Schools ever produced: “ Wisdom is the
principal thing; therefore get &Visdom 3³⁹ Proverbs iv, 7. GIF.
