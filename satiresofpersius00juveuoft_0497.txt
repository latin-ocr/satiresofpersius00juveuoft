OF JUVENAL.

150 Affectus petere auxilium et praestarc juberet,
Dispersos trahere in populum, migrare vetusto
De nemore et proavis habitatas linquere silvas ;
AEdificare domos, Laribus conjungere nostris
Tectum aliud, tutos vicino limine somnos

155 Ut collata daret fiducia3 protegere armis
Lapsum aut ingenti nutantem vulnere civem,
Communi dare signa tuba, defendier isdem
Turribus atque una portarum clave teneri.

Sed jam serpentum major concordia.

153. “Instead of those loose as-
sociadons, which, though they scarcely
diminished their person al indepen denec,
had been sufficient for their security
while they remained in their original
countries, they” (the barbarians of the
north, who had overrun and conquered
Europe.) “ saw the necessity of uniting
in more close confederacy, and of ie-
linquishing some of their private rights
in order to attain public safety;’
ROB, Ch. 5th, Intr. §i,p. 12.

155. “ To repel injuries, and· ο re-
venge wrongs is no less natural to man
than to cultivate friendship· , and while
society remains in its most simple state,
the former is considered as a personal
right no less unalienable than the
latter. Nor do men in this situation
deem that they have a title to redress
their own wrcngs alone; they are
touched with the injuries done to those
with whom they are connected, or in
whose honour they are intere-ned, and
are no less prompt to avenge them.

Parcit

The savage, however imperfectly he
may comprehend the principles of po-
l1t1c1l union, feels warmly the senti·
ments ofsocial affection, and the obliga-
tions arising srom the ties of blood.
On the appearance οῖ’ an injury or
affront offered to his family or tribe, he
kindles into rape, and pursues the au·
thors ofit with the keenest resentment ;”
