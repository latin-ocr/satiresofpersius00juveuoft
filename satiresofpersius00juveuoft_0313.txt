have answered even better than the war-
horse of AEmilius; for Paulus, in pro-
cess of time, obtained great practice,
and, consequently, great riches. Martial

to shake it off entirely: v, 23. This is
one of the few occasions on which
Martial speaks out3 but he was not a
man to carry his independent language
into practice. GIF. MightnotAEmilius

person?
