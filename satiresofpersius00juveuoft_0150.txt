curse;” J. Caes. i, 2. MAD. This
superstitious practice was one ot' the
last Pagan ceremonies that was aban·
doned, and excited the indignation of
many Christian writers. It was finally
abolished by Gelasius; in whose time
nobiles ipsi currebant ,· et matronae mc-
dato corpore vapulabant. GIF. The
festival, which took place in February,
was probably introduced into Italy by
Evander: s. Virg. AEn. viii, 343 f.
The grove there described, which was
also the spot where Romulus and Re-
mus were afterwards found, was fixed
upon by the Romans for the site of
Pan's temple. PRA.

143. See the notes on viii, 192 ff; and
199 ff. R. ‘ Has outdone.' 'l'his may
be an instance of that spirit of aggra-
vation which so much distinguishes
Juvenal. Whatever be the vice which
he lashes, he bestows the whole of his
fury upon it; and in many places the cli-
max of moral reprehension is strangely
perverted. JR. All the writers of
Roman history, however, viewed the
gladiatorship- of the nobility with the
utmost horror. GIF.

144. See viii, 208. ‘ Traversed in
ssight) MAD.

The centre of the amphitheatre was
strewed with ‘ sand,’ to hide the blood
which was spilt. PRA.

the two sons of Paullus, one of whom
was adopted into the family of the
Scipios, the other into that of the Fabii
Maximi.

147. ‘ The sront' or lowest row of
seats was reserved for senators: Suet.
ii, 44. LUB. The podium was the
projecting part of the partition which
divided the seats from the arena. Be-
tween this, and the first row ou which
the senators sat, there was probably
just space enough left for the chairs of
the curule magistrates, dcc. L.

‘'You may even add the personage

See note on i, 97.

148. ‘ The person at whose expense
the games were exhibited' was called
numerarius. GRA. [Quint. viii, 3.]

149. The poet now proceeds to at-
tribute all this gross and degrading
profligat-y to scepticism and infidelity;
to the disbelief of a future state of
rewards and punishments, and, conse-
quently, of the moral government of
the universe. LUB. PRA. MAD.
