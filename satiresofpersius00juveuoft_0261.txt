This was Clr›diu.<; who, uhon a very
young man, had an intrigue with Pom-
peia, the wile sf ‹Julius Caesar. As the
lady was narrowly watched by her
mother-in-laW, Aurelia, they had l'ew
opportunities of meeting; this irritated
their impatience‚ and forced them upon
an expedient, as flagitirssus as it was
new. The myste·ies of the Bona Dea
were so respected by the Romans, that
none but nonen had the privilege of
officiating at tbem; every male, even
of animals, was driven from the house,
and every statne, every picture of the
masculine kind scrupulously veiled.
Clodius dressed himself like a woman⁷
aud knocked at the door of Caesar's
house, where the mysteries were then
celebrating. One of Pompeiana maids,
who was in the secret, let him in; but
unluckily, while she was gone to ac-
quaint her mistress with his arrival,
the impatient Clodius advanced towards
the assembly. On the way, he was
met by another domestic, who. taking
him for one ot* her own sex, began to
toy with him. Clodius was confused3
which the other perceiving, insisted on
knowing who and what he was. His
voice, aud still more his agitation,
betrayed him. The women, struck with
,, horror at such a profanation, covered
the altar and the implements of sacri-

fice with a veil‚ and drove the intruder
from the house. Immer'iutely aster,
they lel't it themselves, and went to
acquaint their husbands with the un-
precedente-d abomination. Clodius was
instanti.. acc-used, and would have been
condemnem but sor the clandestine
influence of Pompey and Caesar, (of
whom lre was a necessary t001‚) and a
species of bribery almost too infamous
sor· belief, though asserted as a fact by
Cicero. GJF. [“ In the Villa Pam-
philia stands the statue of a man in
wornan's cloaths. A learned medallist
in Rome has latcly fixed it to Clodius,
sor one sees the same features and
make of face in a medai of the Clodian
sami'y3'' ADD, R. p. 114.]

33³3. 'she inference is that Pompeia
loved Clodius, because he was more
than twice the man that Caesar was.
Caesar had not only seduced Servilia,
the sister ofCato and mother of Brutus,
x, 319; but had written two books,
against Cicero's work entitled ‘ C ato,’
which he named ι A nti c ato.' Suet. i,
563 Plut. V. xxxiv, Osp. t. i, p. 733, c;
Gell. iv, 16; Cir. Att. xii, 415 xiii,
48 ; Div. ii, 93 Top. 94. R.

The volumes of the ancients were
so called from their cylindrical form.
Sch- GRA. PRA. 'lhere is also an
insinuation that Caesar's honour was
more touched by his wife's infidelity‚
than Cato's was disparaged hy all the
obloquy with which Caesar had assailed
it. LUB.

339. ⁶ Rites held so sacred that the
presence of any male (were it the very
least animal) would be a profanation.'

extreme delicacy is not very unlike
that of the maiden lady, who carried
