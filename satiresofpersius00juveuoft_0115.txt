Patricius ornnes opibus quum provocet unus,

25 Quo tondente gravisjuveni mihi barba sonabat3
Quum pars Niliacae plebis, quum verna Canopi
Crispinus, Tyrias humero revocante lacernas,
Ventilet aestivum digitis sudantibus aurum,

Penthesilea‚Virg. AE. i, 4923 ofCamilla‚
ib. xi, 6493 of Asbyte, Sil. ii, 783 and
of Diana; ib. xii, 715. R.

24. The person here meant is either
Licinus the freedman and barber os Au-
gustus3 (Hor. A. P. 3010 οι· rather
Cinnamus, (x, 225 ς) qui tonsor-fuerat
tota notissimus urbe, etpost le αἰ· dom ι’ nce
munere actus eqnes3 Mart. vii, 64.

25. This line recurs x, 226. GV. It
is a parody on candidior postquam ton·
denti barba oadehat3 Virg. E. i, 29.
PRA. The term juvenis extended to
the middle period of life, which the
words yravis and sonabat seem to denote.
The satirist is pointing out the rapid
rise of his quondam tonsor. GI F.

26. The condition of verna was lower
than that of servus, as being born to
servitude. The latter name is derived
from servare, because generals used to
givequarter to their enemies, and ‘ save’
prisoners in order to sell them: Florent.
Dig. i. 6, 4. The former name was
originally giren to those born during
ver sacrum3 Noun. i, 206: it having
been a custom among the people of
Italy in great emergencies to devote to
the gods whatever should be born during
the next spring. Paul. ex Fest; F.
Livy xxii, 10; 9, ll. Such victims
resembled the Clterem of the Hebrews.
s. J udges xi.

Canopus [twelve miles] from Alex-
andria, was notorious sor a temple of
Serapis, and the scene ofevery grossness
and debauchery. ΓΑΕ. vi, 84; R. xv,
46. PRA. This city was built by
Menelaus and named afterhispilot.Sch.

27. Crispinus rose, under Nero, from
the condition of a slave, to riches and
honours. His connexion with that
monster recommended him to Domitian,
with whom he seems to have been in
high favour: he shared his connsels,
ministered to his amusements, and was
the ready instrument of his cruelties.
For these, and other causeS, Juvenal
regarded him with perfect detestatinn:

and whenererheintroduces him, (which
he does on all occasions) it is with
mingled contempt and horror. Here he
is not only a ‘ Niliacan,‘ (an expression
which conveyed more to Juvenal's mind
than it does to θυι-9,) but a ‘ Canopian,’
a native of the most profligate spot in
Egypt: not only one of the dregs os the
people, but a slave3 and not only a
slave, but a slave born of a slave!
Hence the poet's indignation at his
effeminate luxury. GIF.

The ‘ Tyrian’ purple was a very ex-
pensive dye: x, 383 G. iii, 81: the most
costly dresses were twice dipt3 induerat
Tyrio bis tinctam murice pallam 3 Ov.
F. ii, 107. Lucerna, 62; ix, 28 ;
signifies a ‘ loose upper mantle,⁷ also
called abolla3 GV. nescit cui dederit
Tyriam Crispinus abellam, (lum mutat
cultus, &c3 Martia] viii, 48 GIF.

Rea-ocante has been variously inter-
preted. It may mean that the cloak was
looped up and fastened on the shoulder
by aclasp: G. fibula mordaci resuyas
a pectore vestes dente eapit3 Sidon.
ii, 3963 revocat sulvus in pectore

pelles-3 Claudian. v, 79; xx, 1835 Pru-

dent. Psych. 186 ff. R. Or that, the
weather being hot, the mantle was not
fastened; therefore the shoulder ever
aud anon endeavoured by shrugging to
hoist up and replace the robe 3 which
was as constantly slipping off from
it, and the more so from the waving
of the arm to and fro, 283 MAD.
as well as from the awkwardness of a
wearer but newly accustomed to such
finery. R. The most simple interpre-
tation, however, seems to be that the
delicate shoulder, which in winter had
laid aside its summer mantle for a
warmer cloak, now, with the change of
weather, ⁴ resumed’ its thinner robes:
revocare being opposed to omittere;
