THE SATIRES

himself was present at these most hu-
miliating soenes. As a spectator, we
may conceive him to have wan-hed the
significant looks of the strangch, as
their fingers moved from object to ob-
ject; to have heard thuir whispcrs, to
have noted their sneers! Can it now be
wondered at, that a man of his quick
feelings, of his strong sensibility, should
speak with indignaticn and horror, of
actions which were sure to spread the
disgrace and ridicule of his country, as
far as the wanderings of the astonished
visitants extended τ’) Or, that he should
think them superior in infamy to the
most hateful viees; which, however
they might implicate the character of
individmls, brought no great degree of
odium on the general reputation of
Rome Ρ Howerer this may be, the
praise of consistency must, in the pre-
sent case at least, be fully allowed him.
In this very Satire, when he en ulnerates
the crimes of Nero, he insinuat-:s that
it was not so much his multiplied mur-
ders, as his public exposure of himself
on the stage, (where he repeated his
Troics,) that exhausted the patience of
mankind, and excited that general in-
surrection which swept him from the
earth ἔ GIF.

200 Of the two combatants, who
enter the lists, one was called Retiarins,
and the other Mirmillo or Seeutorz the
former was lightly dressed in a tunic,
and surnished with a trident, or three-
forked spear, and a net, whence his
name. Suet. iv, 30. The latter was
armed with a helmet, shield, and short
scimitar. They approached each other,
the Secutor with his weapon raised, and
the Retiarizts with his protruded trident
in his right hand, and his net open, and
ready for casting, in his left. His
object was to throw it over the head of
his antagonist‚ and entangle him in
such a manner, as to render him an
easy prey. If he failed in his attempt,
he had no resource but flight, for which
his dress wa< well adapted; and during
which he endeavoured to collect and
prepare his net for a second tbrow: if
the Secutor overtook him before this
was done, his fate was inevitable, un-
less he were saved by the interposition
of the spectators, which sometimes

happened. It is not easy, at this dis-
tance of time, to say whether one of
these characters was looked upon as
loss respectable than the other, or not;
but Juvenal seems to direct some of his
indignation at Gracchus, fo.- choosing
the part of the Retiarius, instead of
that of the Seentor: perhaps it was
less danger-ous; it was certainly more
impudent, for it afforded no means of
concealing the face3 since we know,
from Suetonius, that the drivelling
Claudius took a cruel pleasure in putting
the Reticcrii to death upon particular
occasions that he might have the
diabolical satisfaction of remarking the
successive changes in their expiring
vountenances! Suet. v, 34. Gracchus,
however, seems to have been determined
in his choice more by cowardice than
impudence3 as he did not merely rely
upon being recognised by his features,
which, as he was one of the most dis-
tinguished families in Rome, could not
but be well known; but was even base
enough to enter the lists in the mag-

enificent hat and tunic of the Salii, or

priests of Mars, ofwhom he w as probably·
the chief. With respect to the Mirmillo,
he was so called from μόρμυλος. αἰόλος,
ἰχθύς· Opp. Ham, 100 ; a representation
οῖ’ which formed the crest ot' his helmet.
Polyaenus and Festus derive the origin
of the Retiarizcs from Pittacus, one of
the seven sages of Greece who fought
in this manner with Phrynoz ὕστερον δὲ

xiii. A similar practice is spoken of
as· exis-tine among the Persian forces:
Σαγάρτιοι χρέωνται σειρῇσι πεπλεγμένῃσι

201. Two other sorts of gladiator-s
may be here meant: viz. (1) the Secutor,
clypeo puynans3 and (2) the Threx,
with his falchion. R. AD. [s. “ Thraem’'
Fes. Sen. Q. N. iv, 2. R]
