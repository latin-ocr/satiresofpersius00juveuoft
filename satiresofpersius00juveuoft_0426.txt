THE SATIRES

SAT. XII.

Catullus,

Pro cujus reditu tot pono altaria, parvos

95 Tres habet heredes.

Libet exspectare, quis aegram

Et claudentem oculos gallinam impendat amico

Tam sterili.

Verum haec nimia est impensa: coturnix
Nulla umquam pro patre cadet.

Semire calorem

Si coepit locuples Gvallita et Paccius orbi,

100 Legitime fixis vestitur tota tabellis
Porticus: exsistunt, qui promittant hecatomben,
Quatenus hic non sunt nec venales elephanti
Nec Latio aut usquam nostro sub sidere talis
Belua concipitur3 sed furva gente petita

105 Arboribus Rutulis et Turni pascitur agro,
Caesan's armentum nulli servire paratum

solemn fighting of lamps wa3, undoubt-
edly, the primal indication of idolatry;

the first profane ceremony which took R

place, when men fell from worshipping
the Father of Light‚ to the adoration
of the noblest material object, the sun,
of which those artifieial fires were the
most obvious symbol. The institution
itself, that of the Festival of Lamps,
shows the universality of this specious
worship; as it would be difficult to
point out a region, in which it has not,
at one period or other, prevailed. [t
extends even now, though the origin
and object of it have been forgotten for
ages, over more than half the habitable
globe. The Christians continued it
after their conversion from paganism:
sed luceant, inquit (Christus) opera
vestra .· at mmo lacent taberna> etjmmae
nostrae: plures jam invenies Etlmi-
eorumfores sine lucernis el laureisqztam
C'lzrislimzorum. Tertull. The transition
of this illumination, from a mark of
veneration to a simple type of joy and
festivity, is neither singular nor difficult
to explain. GIF. DJID.

101. Hecatombs were only offered on
the most solemn and urgent occasions.
A hundred altars were erected, and a
hundred victims simultaneously sacri-
ficed. The victims properly were oxen,
but might also be sheep, goats, or any
other animals. Emperors are said to
have sometimes offered a hundred lions,
or a hundred eagles. AX. ROD.
