THE SATIRES

SAT. VIII.

Cujus supplicio non debuit una parari
Simia nec serpens unus nec culeus unus?
215 Par Agamemnonidae crimen 3 sed causa facit rem

Dissimilem.

Quippe ille deis auctoribus ultor

Patris erat caesi media inter pocula3 sed nec
Electrae jugulo se polluit aut Spartani
Sanguine conjugii, nullis aconita propinquis

avarice and rapacity3 and P. Suilius
appears, from Tacitus, to have attacked
him on this head, with a violence which
no common arts of enriching himself
could have provoked. “ By what sys-

tem of ethics has this professor, in less
than four years, amassed three hundred
million sesterces Ξ) His snares are spread
through all the city; last wills and
testaments are his quarry, and the rich,
who have no children, are his prey.
Italy is overwhelmed, the provinces
are exhausted3 and he is still unsatis-
fied!⁷⁷ Tae. A.xiii, 42. His behaviour
ton, after he perceived the decline of
Nero's favour, was pusillanimous3 and
his affected resignation ofhis unbounded
wealth, pitiful in the extreme. He did
not, indeed, imitate the elder Brutus,

for what Juvenal calls the time of
bearded lrings was past3 but he fcigned
himself sick and infirm, and lived on
spring water and bread baked under
his own eye. In a word, there is little
amiable in his life; and in his boasted
death, scarcely any thing more than a
fond and over-weening anxiety to make
an exhibition of it. None ofour writers
have entered into the character of
Seneca with more discrimination than
Massinger, who was very eonversant
with his works, and who, in the Maid
of Honour, describes him in these ad-
mirable lines, · “ '1¹hus⁷'—re0apitulating
some of his stoical paradoxes s‘-— 44 Thus
Seneca, when he wrote it, thought.—
But then Felicity courted him, his
weallh exceeding A private man s· ,
happy in the embraces Of his ehaste
wife Paulina3111shouse fullOfchildren,
client, selvantS, flattering friends,
Soothing ris lip-positions;--then, no
doubt, He held, and did believe, this.
But no sooner The prince's frowns and
jealousies had thrown him Out of secu-
rity's lap, and a. centurion Had offered
him what choice of death he pleased,
But told him, diehe1n11<t; when straight

the armour this so boasted fortitude fell
off, Complaining of his frailty. '³ GIF.

Ores es slew liis mother Clytaemnes-

father and had usur-ped the kingdom

ungrateful son. Se'n. R. GIF.
